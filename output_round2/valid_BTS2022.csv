their operations until it becomes an organisational culture,Social

In order to ensure appropriate business strategies are put in place BTS Group carries out regular determination and reviews paying close attention to political development and changes in government policies,Social
BTS Group has prepared an appropriate risk management system for each business unit to develop and implement risk management guidelines managing risks specific to each business unit,Governance
For example in the first quarter of an act of terrorism caused the BTS Skytrain to suspend its operations for a full days limiting its services for several days incurring a loss of approximately THB mn to BTS Group,Social
In the first half of BTSC reduced its service hours due to the imposed curfew in response to the political unrest in Bangkok,Social
Most recently the government initiated a policy to control the outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID resulting in a reduction of its service hours,Social
As for the other trains car trains purchased from CRRC they will be maintained and repaired by BTSC,Social
At present BTSC has been using its own employees to maintain part of the train system such as the automatic fare collection radio communication and signal transmission system,Social
In addition to decreasing its reliance on the train manufacturers BTSC also implements policies to uplift the capabilities of its engineering and maintenance units of tools and equipment relating to the train network,Social
Personnel Risk Hiring and retaining employees are challenging and expensive especially within the mass transit business and related to data analysis under MIX business as the required personnel needs to possess high levels of experience knowledge expertise with specific skill sets,Social
Consequently BTS Group has to occasionally depend on external or international service providers to fill the positions where such expertise are required,Social
The Company has not experienced any organised labour unions or collective work stoppage,Social
As such BTS Group emphasises on the importance of constant management and development of employees by organising training for its personnel and midlevel executives to take part in planning management plans to improve their capabilities knowledge and experience,Social

Reputation Risk The BTS brand has achieved nationwide recognition with customer satisfaction surveys indicating positive public perception,Social
However despite monitoring and analysing customer satisfaction on a regular basis the business is still exposed to organisational reputation risk,Governance

BTS Group has always been committed to its business goals principles and values which are based on honesty and responsibility,Governance
It aims to balance and create values to be shared among its businesses as well as emphasising the business operation under sustainable growth that takes into account communities the environment and the best interests of all stakeholders,Social

BTS Group has established a COVID War Room to manage and monitor the pandemic situation closely and effectively,Social
The Company has prepared a pandemic response plan that outlines health and safety measures for employees partners and passengers such as social distancing measures temperature checks preparation of hand sanitising alcohol mask wearing and cleaning and disinfecting inside trains and stations etc,Social
Given the current uncertainty the Company expects the spread of COVID to ease when the government declares endemic along with the rising vaccination rates,Social
The Company believes that this scenario as well as an ample number of individuals were acclimated to New Normal behaviour will lessen the impact of COVID pandemic,Social
Other Risks Environmental Risk The Group places great importance on environmental risk management,Environmental
The BTS mass transit system is an environmentally friendly operator emitting low carbon emissions compared to other modes of transport utilising electricity as its primary source of energy,Environmental
However the BTS mass transit system may emit more greenhouse gas emissions from the continuous expansion of the rail transport network,Environmental
According to the Groups analysis and current expansion plans the BTS mass transit system will release more greenhouse gas emissions by approximately per year starting from,Environmental
Therefore the reduction plan on greenhouse gas emissions is included in the Companys longterm Climate Strategy to retain Carbon Neutral status and to improve the proportion of electricity usage from renewable energy sources to at least of its total usage,Environmental
Furthermore the plan layouts the strategy to offset carbon emissions by participating in the Carbon Credit program and improving the Groups operating efficiency which includes studies in environmental management projects along with providing support and cooperation in various greenhouse gas emission reduction projects initiated by governmental agencies,Environmental
At present the Group operates its business in accordance with environmental laws and the requirements of relevant environmental standards such as pollution control environmental impact assessment EIA and environmental impact mitigation measures,Environmental
In addition policies and operating guidelines are formulated to respond to future changes in environmental laws,Environmental
Risks and opportunities are assessed in accordance with the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures to determine the organisations approach in addressing the risks of climate change and risks associated with government legislation and regulations to address environmental issues,Environmental
Further details can be considered under the Sustainability Report at Risk Management Review BTS Group Holdings Public Company Limited Annual Report However if the legal and regulatory requirements of the government in solving such environmental problems become more stringent the Group may require additional investments to further improve upon its operational practices,Environmental
The decision to invest in a lowcarbon business including a clean energy production business and building a network to support climate change could result in a higher cost for the business,Environmental
Social and Community Risks The Company places great importance on human rights issues whereby it established and implemented Human Rights Due Diligence which comprises of policies on human rights human rights impact assessment the prevention and mitigation of human rights impacts and the monitoring and reporting on human rights impact assessments,Social

As such part of the daily life economic activities and payment has become more towards digitalised whether through applications or the internet on the mobile phone virtual conference platforms or elearning which allows people to work shop and study from home without traveling via the mass transit system or reduce the use of public transport due to occupational health concerns,Social
These changes are shortterm social and technology change resulting from macroeconomics factors which could be seen in years,Social
applications such as Rabbit LINE Pay and the improvement on the distribution business unit Kerry Express Thailand to make it more efficient in order to support the increasing demand on eCommerce,Social
This diversification of risk will help support and cater to the changes in consumer behaviour and sustainably to strengthen the growth of our revenue,Social
Risk of Entering into an Aging Society The change of the population structure into an aging society is an issue to which many countries around the world are paying attention,Social

private hire cars taxis buses MRT or other modes of services eg,Social
payment services online trade or other delivery services that are more responsive to the specific needs and necessities of the elderly,Social
In response to this risk the Group plans to accommodate the transition towards an aging society,Social
This includes improving the train stations and trains by adding adequate and suitable facilities for the elderly such as escalators passenger lifts ramp stairs handrails passenger seats development of public relations media and payment modes that are convenient for the elderly user friendly interface as well as personnel training to create understanding and awareness of service to the elderly at all levels,Social
Moreover the Group has also linked online and offline advertising media and develop consumer insights analytics technology based on Big Data from the Groups various platforms,Social
