The regulation mandated that sulphur levels in fuel oils consumed by ships outside emission control areas not to exceed by mass referred to as Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil or VLSFO,Environmental
Initial concerns regarding the quality of VLSFO being supplied at several ports and suitability for use on ships equipment that were designed primarily for use with fuels with higher sulphur levels which contributed towards lubricity as well as optimum viscosity have largely been addressed and there have been no major incidents in our fleet on account of the quality or availability of VLSFO,Environmental
Ships need to take ballast basically sea water in dedicated ballast tanks on board so that the ship remains stable when there is no cargo on board and so that the ships propeller is kept well submerged in the water,Environmental
Administrations of most countries in the world insist on stringent ballast water management practices on board ships so that potentially invasive aquatic life forms from one part of the world do not get deposited in their waters thereby affecting the local ecosystem,Environmental
Hence the need for regulations that require ships to treat the ballast water taken in the ballast tanks by means of approved Ballast Water Treatment Systems BWTS which need to be installed on board,Environmental
The IMO Ballast Water Management Convention entered into force on September months after ratification by States representing of world merchant shipping tonnage,Environmental
All vessels are required to carry a Ballast Water Management certificate,Environmental
New vessels built date of keel laying after the above date are required to be fitted with IMO approved ballast treatment plants and existing vessels are required to retrofit such plants in a phased manner along with surveys associated with the first renewal of IOPP International Oil Pollution Prevention certificate after September,Environmental
USCG as well as IMO approved BWTS have already been fitted on vessels in PSLs fleet,Social

Decarbonization in shipping Overview of the regulatory framework In the Paris Agreement on climate change was agreed by parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCCC,Environmental
Its goal is to keep global temperature rise below C above preindustrial levels and preferably limited to C,Environmental
Even though the Paris Agreement does not include international shipping the International Maritime Organization IMO committed to contribute its efforts to address climate change features prominently in its strategic plan,Environmental
Consequently in April IMO adopted an initial strategy on the reduction of greenhouse gas GHG from ships ie,Environmental
emissions including carbon dioxide CO methane CH and nitrous oxide NO expressed in COe carbon dioxide equivalent,Environmental
ANNUAL REPORT Precious Shipping Public Company Limited The IMOs initial strategy envisages a reduction of the average carbon intensity carbon dioxide CO emissions per transport work of international shipping by at least by pursuing efforts towards by as compared to levels and to reduce total annual GHG emissions from shipping by at least by compared to while pursuing efforts towards phasing them out entirely within this century,Environmental
is the baseline year against which future reduction targets are assessed while represents an important milestone in the Paris Agreement which the IMO explicitly references in its strategy,Environmental
These ambitions are to be accomplished by a blend of measures applicable in the short medium and longterm,Environmental
Measures have been recently adopted by the IMO as amendments to the MARPOL Annex VI requiring ships to take a technical and operational approach to reduce their carbon intensity,Environmental
The mid and longterm measures are likely to require a high degree of innovation and to result in the global uptake of new fuels and new technologies,Environmental
Shipping emissions The focus of maritime sector was drawn to air emissions in when air pollution was included in MARPOL as Annex VI,Environmental
For the first time limits were set on main air pollutants contained in ships exhaust gas including sulphur oxides SOx and nitrous oxides NOx and prohibiting deliberate emissions of ozonedepleting substances,Environmental
This annex has since undergone several amendments to reflect the increased focus on reducing ship emissions for example on January a sulphur content limit in the fuel oil used on board ships came into force marking a significant milestone to improve air quality,Environmental
Even though shipping is one of the most energy efficient modes of mass transport it was estimated to have contributed about to the global emissions of CO in,Environmental
As sea transport continues to grow in tandem with world trade it is imperative to have a global approach to further improve the energy efficiency and effective emission control of the maritime sector,Environmental
According to the fourth IMO greenhouse gas study which was published in the GHG emissions of total shipping international domestic and fishing have increased from million tonnes in to million tonnes in a increase,Environmental
Over the period from to the carbon intensity of shipping operations improved by about but these efficiency gains were outstripped by growth in activity,Environmental
If changes are not made shipping emissions are projected to increase by up to until relative to despite further efficiency gains as transport demand is expected to continue to grow,Environmental
The seventyfifth session of the IMOs Marine Environment Protection Committee MEPC held in November approved the findings of this study and measures to reduce GHG emissions from international shipping were deliberated,Environmental
Consequently in June MEPC adopted amendments to MARPOL Annex VI to reflect the technical and operational goalbased measures to reduce the carbon intensity of international shipping,Environmental
IMO Regulations The International Context The IMO has been actively engaged in a global approach to enhance ships energy efficiency and develop measures to reduce GHG emissions from ships,Environmental
The first major step to reduce these emissions was announced in when the IMO adopted mandatory measures to increase energy efficiency of international shipping,Environmental
This paved the way for the regulations on Energy Efficiency Design Index EEDI for new ships and Ship Energy Efficiency and Management Plan SEEMP a shipspecific document that provides a mechanism to help improve the energy efficiency of a ship in a costeffective manner,Environmental
These mandatory measures EEDISEEMP entered into force on January while targets to improve design efficiency EEDI of new build ships commenced in,Environmental
ANNUAL REPORT Precious Shipping Public Company Limited For new ships the EEDI requires that energy efficiency is improved in phases such that CO emissions are progressively reduced,Environmental
During phase one running from January to December the EEDI requires a reduction of carbon intensity below the relevant reference line for newly built ships,Environmental
In phase two running from January to December the EEDI requires up to reduction of carbon intensity,Environmental
Phase three of the EEDI due to commence in requires an additional reduction ie ships being built in will be required to be more carbon efficient than those built in between to,Environmental
A carbon intensity reduction requirement will apply to containerships starting with reduction rate for small container vessels and increasing up to for large containerships DWT and above,Environmental
In addition to the above since under the IMO Data Collection System IMODCS ships of GT and above must collect and report data on fuel consumption under SEEMP Part II,Environmental
These ships account for close to of CO emissions from international shipping,Environmental
The European Union EU has also implemented similar regulations on monitoring reporting and verifying fuel consumption EUMRV for ships of GT and above calling at European ports,Environmental
While IMODCS is an anonymous public database the EUMRV is a distinctive public database,Social
More recently during the MEPC meeting in June amendments relating to technical and operational measures to cut the carbon intensity of international shipping were adopted,Environmental
These amendments will enter into force on November and include the following calculation and verification of Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index EEXI retroactive EEDI requirements applied to existing ships from January introduction of a rating mechanism A to E linked to the operational Carbon Intensity Indicator CII taking effect from January and enhanced Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan SEEMP to include targets for operational emissions where an,Environmental
approved SEEMP needs to be kept onboard from January,Social
Technical Measures Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index EEXI Like the EEDI the aim of the EEXI is to measure ships energy efficiency based on its design and arrangements,Environmental
As such it is required to develop an EEXI Technical File which includes the data used for calculation and will be used as a basis for verification of compliance,Governance
Essentially the EEXI describes the carbon emissions per cargo ton and mile,Environmental
It determines the standardized CO emissions related to installed engine power fuel oil consumption and a conversion factor between fuel and the corresponding CO mass,Environmental
The calculation does not consider the maximum engine power but for most ship types it is of the rated installed power MCR or in case where overridable ANNUAL REPORT Precious Shipping Public Company Limited power limitation is installed it is of the limited installed power MCRlim,Environmental
Specific fuel oil consumption of the main engine and ship speed are regarded for this specific power,Environmental
For ships where the calculated or attained EEXI is greater than the required there will be a need to implement countermeasures to improve its efficiency index,Environmental
Some of the available options are introduction of an engine power limitation or shaft power limitation increasing ship capacity by increasing the deadweight DWT or gross tonnage GT if structurally possible propulsion optimization devices eg high efficiency propellers propeller boss cap fins Mewis duct low friction paints air lubrication systems etc,Environmental
energy efficiency technologies EETs such as waste heat recovery wind assisted propulsion solar cells etc,Environmental
switching to carbonneutral fuel but this might not be viable for most existing ships due to very high capital expenditure CAPEX,Environmental
The regulations are not prescriptive on which improvement method should be deployed and the right solution may vary based on ship type and size,Social
It is vital to consider the ships age against the cost and payback time of improvement option,Social
The EEXI Technical File will need to be approved by the ships Flag State or Class and the compliance with the EEXI regime will be reflected in the International Energy Efficiency Certificate IEEC at the first annual intermediate or renewal survey of the International Air Pollution Prevention IAPP certificate on or after January for ships delivered before January or at the initial survey of IEEC for ships delivered on or after January,Environmental
As for the rest of the vessels in the fleet the engine power will have to be limited by installing EPL on or before the first IAPP International Air Pollution Prevention Annual survey after st Jan,Environmental
We are pleased to inform that all these vessels have already been installed with an EPL device well ahead of the deadline,Social
Operational Measures Carbon Intensity Indicator CII and enhanced Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan SEEMP The CII is an operational measure applicable to ships of GT and above which aligns with the requirements for recording a ships fuel consumption in accordance with the IMO Data Collection System IMO DCS,Environmental
As per the revised MARPOL Annex VI regulation from applicable vessels will need to ANNUAL REPORT Precious Shipping Public Company Limited calculate attained annual operational CII over a month period from January to December in that calendar year and demonstrate reductions of carbon intensity from to,Environmental
The reduction rates are intended to achieve the levels of ambitions set out in the IMOs initial strategy in particular the level of ambition of reducing carbon intensity of international shipping by at least by compared to,Environmental
Ships will be given an annual carbon intensity rating CII rating indicating their performance over the previous year,Environmental
The attained annual operational carbon intensity indicator will be based on IMODCS,Environmental
Emissions data must be submitted through the IMODCS in addition to the existing fuel consumption requirement,Environmental
Emissions reporting must as a minimum include the AER for bulk carriers tankers container ships general cargo LNG carriers gas carriers combination carriers and reefers,Environmental
For the PSL Fleet the enhanced SEEMPIII as required has already been developed certified by the vessels Class and placed on board,Social
From January ships will be issued with a Statement of Compliance SoC covering verified fuel consumption attained carbon intensity reduction and an annual rating A to E based on carbon intensity reduction performance against the required carbon intensity reduction,Environmental
Ships rated D for three consecutive years or at rating E for one year will have to submit and implement a corrective action plan showing how they can improve the vessels efficiency to C or above,Social
Periodic SEEMP verification audits will be introduced to ensure plans are in place to achieve the targets and ensure correction plans are being followed where a ship is rated E in any given year or D in three consecutive years,Social
The frequency and specific requirements of these audits is expected to be discussed at MEPC in November with guidance developed in,Governance
ANNUAL REPORT Precious Shipping Public Company Limited In addition to the above the MEPC approved a phased approach of carbon intensity reduction as compared to the reference line from when the MARPOL amendments would enter into force through to when another review to further strengthen the annual reduction rate is due to take place Year Annual reduction factor from reference Still to be decided If regular improvements are,Environmental
not made a ships CII rating could drop as the targets will become increasingly strict every year,Social
A consequence of this could be a loss of earnings and inability to trade so there is a strong incentive to improve energy efficiency,Environmental

Other industry developments and new technologies The International Chamber of ICS has put forward a proposal to the IMO calling for internationally Shipping accepted marketbased measures to accelerate the uptake and deployment of zerocarbon fuels,Environmental
A levy would be based on mandatory contributions by ships of GT and above trading globally for each tonne of CO emitted,Environmental
Funds raised from the levy would go into an IMO Climate Fund to accelerate the development of new fuels and infrastructure,Environmental
The new carbon levy proposal comes on top of an existing proposal by the industry to the IMO for a USD per tonne bunker fuel levy to create a USD billion research fund for shipping decarbonization,Environmental
The maritime finance and chartering sectors have also recognised their role in making shipping greener by creating the Poseidon Principles and Sea Cargo Charter a framework for financial institutions and shipping interests including charterers and cargo owners to ensure that their interests are aligned with the targets set out in the IMOs greenhouse gas strategy,Environmental

ANNUAL REPORT Precious Shipping Public Company Limited A future nextgeneration bulk carrier Courtesy of K Line K Line developed a conceptual design for tonnes class capesize bulk carrier in collaboration with Namura Shipbuilding and Taiyo Electric,Social
By selecting LNG as the primary fuel an energysaving vessel has been designed that helps reduce GHG emissions,Environmental
The design was further enhanced by adopting permanent magnet PM shaft generator technology along with lithiumion batteries,Environmental
Moreover by using batteries as part of the platform for power supply onboard the aim is to further reduce emissions going forward by later adding green energy sources with energysaving technology,Environmental
Using LNG as fuel allows for the reduction of GHG emissions by to per cent compared to the use of conventional heavy fuel oil,Environmental
In addition to the equipment for greenhouse gas emissions reduction under the recent AIPs the goal is to further reduce emissions going forward by installing various optional technologies,Environmental
In the new postPanamax carrier design emissions will be reduced by using largecapacity batteries instead of a dualfuel generator during cargo loading and unloading,Environmental
In the new capesize carrier design the battery capacity will be greater due to the amount of power required during cargo handling,Environmental
Here emissions during cargo handling will also be reduced by enabling vessel connection to shore power,Environmental

That said a number of regions such as North America North Sea Caribbean and Baltic follow regulations that are stricter than the global standard and have from January required that vessels in these regions burn fuel with a maximum sulphur content of no more than,Environmental
The switchover from sulphur fuel to sulphur fuel in was initially expected to be challenging due to the uncertainty regarding the availability and cost of compliant fuel,Environmental
The transition however was relatively smooth and now three years after the regulation entering into force there seem to be no problems with the availability of the new grade of compliant fuel with sulphur content below ANNUAL REPORT Precious Shipping Public Company Limited by mass,Environmental
Shipowners had the option of installing an exhaust gas scrubber unit in which case fuel with a higher sulphur content HSFO could be used,Environmental
The scrubber would then wash down and reduce the sulphur levels in the exhaust to below levels VLSFO,Environmental
Installing of scrubber unit on vessels however presented several challenges both technical as well as financial,Environmental
Several design flaws became apparent during the past few years as most of the commercially available scrubbers frequently brokedown at sea,Environmental
There were a few cases where the ships were left immobilizedincapacitated due to extensive damage to the scrubber units themselves and in certain cases also to the main propulsion machinery,Environmental
In addition several countries have banned the discharge of wash water from OpenLoop Scrubbers in their coastal waters and it is possible that these restrictions may spread globally,Environmental
With the price differential between HSFO and VLSFO progressively decreasing PSLs decision not to install scrubbers on our vessels and to consume compliant fuel only VLSFO on our vessels instead has proven to be a correct one,Environmental

Various national governments and international regulatory bodies have begun requiring that more stringent environmental regulations be applied to vessels,Environmental
Our Technical Management team and International Safety Management team work proactively to evaluate compliance risks and any potential regulatory risks pertaining to the shipping business,Social
B The decarbonization challenge Global pollution is a major threat to the survival of our planet and the shipping industry is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions,Environmental
The shipping industry is responsible for a significant portion of global emissions of pollutants such as carbon dioxide which contribute to climate change,Environmental
The Paris Agreement which was adopted in aims to limit global warming to well below degrees Celsius and to pursue efforts to limit warming to degrees Celsius,Environmental
COP highlighted that the shipping sector was not on track to achieve these targets and that the action plan fell short of what was needed to limit warming to degrees,Environmental
It is essential that the shipping industry takes steps to reduce its emissions and to decarbonize its operations in order to meet these targets and prevent further damage to our planet,Environmental
It is imperative that the shipping industry takes action to reduce emissions to meet its decarbonization targets,Environmental
However a significant amount of uncertainty surrounds projected carbon reduction trajectories for companies committed to decarbonization because of the uncertainty over future propulsion and technology,Environmental
The transition to more sustainable and zerocarbon fuels is crucial for the shipping industry to meet its decarbonization goals but the production and availability of these fuels is still in its early stages,Environmental
Additionally currently there is no commercially viable green fuel that can substitute heavy fuel oil,Environmental
ANNUAL REPORT Precious Shipping Public Company Limited C ClimateChange Risk We recognize that climate change is the most pressing issue of our time and we are determined to take stronger steps to manage climatechange risks,Environmental
It is likely that governments and regulators around the world will enact more stringent regulations to control emissions in coming years which may affect the operations of the Company,Environmental
Furthermore extreme climate and weather events pose a serious threat to our crew and assets,Environmental
A comprehensive analysis of the risks and opportunities posed by climatechange is provided in the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures TCFD Report,Environmental
Trade in regions that are engulfed in conflict can have a significant adverse impact on the shipping industry,Social
These conflicts can result in increased risks for crew members as ships may be targeted or detained in areas of conflict,Social
A prolonged conflict might have further repercussions including an impact on demand for various commodities,Social
A more stringent sanctions regime against certain countries can make compliance challenging and violations can result in severe penalties and consequences for ship owners and counterparties,Governance
F Cybersecurity risks The shipping industry has become more susceptible to cyberattacks due to increased automation and digitalization,Social
Covid accelerated the Companys effort to move towards further digitalization and technological advancement while transitioning to remote work,Social

An important regulation that was put into force on January was the IMO Sulphur cap regulation under which all oceangoing vessels are required to consume low Sulphur fuel oil to power their diesel engines and boilers,Environmental
As an alternative to burning low Sulphur fuel oil some Shipowners have installed scrubbers on board their vessels enabling them to continue burning the lower grade high Sulphur fuel oil,Environmental
Scrubbers perform the function of cleaning the main engine exhaust gases but result in the production of toxic washwater,Environmental
In most cases this toxic washwater is discharged into the sea effectively transferring pollution from the air into the ocean,Environmental
Given the harmful impact of this toxic wash water on marine life most major trading nations have banned the discharge of this washwater in their harbors thereby nullifying much of the economic benefit derived from this equipment,Environmental
The Company has chosen to implement the IMO Sulphur regulation by burning compliant low Sulphur fuel oil rather than installing scrubbers,Environmental
Firstly there continued to be an increased frequency of breakdowns associated with scrubbers which impacted vessel operations and therefore the earnings of vessels which have installed this equipment,Environmental
Secondly most major trading nations banned the discharge of washwater from openloop scrubbers rendering them inoperable much of the time when they reached or were in most ports,Environmental
Its commitment to environmental protection has been formalized in its Environmental Policy which is based on ISO standards along with established internal guidelines that outline its efforts to address environmental issues throughout its business activities,Environmental
The Company promotes the use of new technologies and innovation to help reduce its environmental impact,Environmental

The risk of skill shortages and loss of key personnel Human resource management is important for a companys success because it helps ensure that the company has the right people with the right skills to meet its business objectives,Social
To manage this risk the company should focus on hiring compliance employee growth and recruiting qualified specialists and talents,Social
The operations of vessels and the management of the Company as a public company listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand requires skilled personnel to be employed as crew to operate its vessels and skilled managers to be employed at the corporate level with appropriate knowledge and experience,Social
The Company mitigates these risks through the adoption of a fair staffing policy and has thus far been quite successful in sourcing and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel,Social
In addition the Company continues to take several initiatives including the establishment of a detailed Succession Plan to attract and retain talent and therefore does not expect any future cause for concern in this regard although international shipping continues to face a shortage of experienced crew particularly in the officers cadre required on board the vessels,Social
Supply chain related risks Managing supply chain and logistics of stores and spare parts is crucial for ensuring our vessels performance compliance with technical requirements imposed by regulating authorities and minimizing operating costs,Social

In addition to minimum requirements based on international conventions and regulations the Company implements an Environment Management System EMS complying with the ISO standards,Environmental
ISO provides a framework for a holistic strategic approach to the Companys environmental policy plans and actions and demonstrates that the Company is an environmentally responsible organization,Environmental
The Company first obtained the Certificate of Environment Management Systems Registration issued by Class NK in the year as per the standards of ISO,Environmental
The EMS supplements the Quality Management System meeting ISO standard and the ISM code,Governance
This integrated Management System is known as Safety Quality and Environment Management System SQEMS,Social
According to the SQEMS the Technical Manager who also heads the Management Company is appointed as the Management Representative and is also the Designated Person for the purpose of the ISM code,Governance
Most dry bulk shipping companies do not obtain this certification which is the exclusive preserve of tanker companies where protection of the environment is the paramount issue,Environmental
We however choose to hold ourselves to a much higher nonmandatory standard,Governance
Objectives of the EMS Minimize pollution caused to the environment Comply with all national international legislations and other regulations pertaining to pollution of the environment Establish procedures for the efficient use of natural resources Improve environmental awareness of all employees Ensure effective monitoring of the environmental performance of the Company is carried out Ensure continual improvement of environmental performance and pollution prevention ANNUAL REPORT,Environmental
Precious Shipping Public Company Limited Through periodic review and continual improvement of our SQEMS the Company hopes to elevate environmental performance over the coming years and make significant contribution to conservation of the environment and reducing the Companys carbon footprint,Environmental
Another tangible effort being made by the Company to reduce the environmental impact of the business is the adoption of new environment friendly technology on new ships acquired,Environmental
Use of New Technology and Innovations GRI The Companys commitment to protection and conservation of the environment and prevention of pollution is reflected in the newbuilding vessels that the Company ordered and took delivery from various shipyards in China as explained in this Annual Report,Environmental
In addition wherever practical the vessels specifications exceed those mandated by regulations both for ease of operations as well as to enhance the vessels ability to protect and conserve the environment,Environmental
Double Hull construction is utilized for DWT bulkers to minimize environmental pollution in case of accidental hull damage,Environmental
The vessels hull form was perfected after several rounds of careful design analysis using the latest technology with a view to arrive at the most optimal combination of shipsize shape to achieve the desired speed at minimum fuel consumption,Environmental
The fuel consumption of these vessels is far less than comparable sized older ships,Environmental
Such low fuel consumption is achieved by combining a highly fuel efficient main engine with a new design of slowspeed large diameter and highefficiency propeller on an optimized hull form,Environmental
To reduce carbon footprint and increase thermal efficiency of these ships the exhaust of auxiliary engines is routed through the composite boiler,Environmental
This improves wasteheat recovery and reduces the consumption of oil for the burner,Environmental
These ships were fitted with onboard treatment plants for ballast water which fully comply with IMO regulations enforced from September,Environmental
These treatment plants are designed to remove render harmless and thereby prevent the transfer of harmful bacteria and invasive species of microlife through ballasting and deballasting operations between ports,Environmental
Engines fitted follow the required Nitrogen oxide NOx emission standards,Environmental
The DWT ships have flush boxtype shipsides for cargo holds,Social
This reduces the accumulation of cargo residues in the holds thereby reducing the need for harmful cleaning chemicals for removal of the same since the holds can be cleaned using water only,Environmental
Deepwell sump pumps for Main Engine oil circulating system this reduces the overall quantity of lubricating oil required for the Main Engines which in due course reduces the quantities of waste oil,Environmental
The vessels were fitted with large incinerators well above the requirements of MEPC Standards to burn waste and sludge,Environmental
This ably supplements the Companys garbage and waste management system which is already in operation on all the Companys vessels,Environmental
Larger capacity Bilge watersludge storage tanks these enable environmentally friendly waste disposal ashore by allowing more flexibility in selecting the best waste disposal facilities ashore separately for oily water and sludge,Environmental
Improved biobased Sewage Treatment Plants are installed on the ships,Environmental
Ships follow the IMOs Ship Recycling Convention The Hong Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships was adopted in May,Environmental
It is aimed at ensuring that ships when recycled after reaching the end of their operational lives do not pose ANNUAL REPORT Precious Shipping Public Company Limited any unnecessary risk to human health and safety or to the environment,Environmental
Presently the Convention is open for accession by States,Social
Though the convention has not yet come into force our fleet is already compliant with this requirement and all ships hold a International Certificate of Inventory of Hazardous Material IHM,Environmental
Ecofriendly ships Shipping is one of the cleanest and greenest industries among all international transport industries,Social
It is also an environmentally friendly and fuelefficient industry,Environmental
It is estimated that shipping carries roughly of world trade and yet according to the latest figures published in following the th GHG study international shipping is responsible for just of global CO emissions,Environmental
The shipping industry has not yet solved all its green issues,Environmental
Present endeavors of the industry and the IMO are twofold For existing vessels Reduce intensity of carbon emissions by imposing restrictions on design as well as operational parameters,Environmental
For new vessels Use of improved hull designs and more fuelefficient engines and technology,Environmental
Ballast Water Treatment GRI Ballast water if discharged without treatment could cause damage to the local ecosystem at the point of discharge,Environmental
Ballast water treatment is a process used by ships to remove harmful organisms and pathogens from their ballast water before it is released into the ocean,Environmental
This can help prevent the spread of invasive species and protect marine biodiversity,Environmental
Presently the Companys policy is to carry out mid ocean ballast water exchange to prevent the transfer of harmful aquatic organisms at the point of discharge,Environmental
This already serves to mitigate if not totally cut out the damage to the indigenous biodiversity of the ports the Companys vessels visits,Social
The Ballast Water Management Convention came into force on September,Environmental
All new vessels keel laid from this date are required to be fitted with IMO approved ballast treatment plants,Environmental
All existing vessels are required to retrofit such plants in a phased manner along with surveys associated with first renewal of IOPP International Oil Pollution Prevention certificate after September,Environmental
The Company has already fitted Ballast Water Treatment plants on vessels in our fleet as of December,Environmental
One remaining vessel will be fitted with a Ballast Water Treatment plant in Q,Environmental
Fresh Water The Company recognizes that water resources are a critical component of the ecosystems where the Company conducts its business,Environmental
The Company is committed to lowering fresh water obtained ashore,Environmental
To reduce the water received from shorebased sources the Company produces water through the freshwater generators on board each vessel,Environmental
A freshwater generator is a vital machinery system used onboard ships,Environmental
This machine is used for the conversion of seawater into freshwater by vacuum distillation based on evaporation and condensation,Environmental
However the remaining fresh water for consumption is sourced from ashore,Environmental
Arguably this eats into the fresh water supply available for communities ashore and so it is our endeavor to reduce water sourced from shorebased sources over time,Environmental
ANNUAL REPORT Precious Shipping Public Company Limited The Company has set a goal of reducing water purchased from shorebased sources by by the year compared to a baseline year,Environmental
The Company will take measures to reduce water consumption on board by encouraging ships crew to minimize wastage of fresh water and maintain fresh water generators on a regular basis so as to maximize production of fresh water on board,Environmental
Water Purchase Data from PSLs fleet Description Water received by the whole fleet of the Company from onshore per annum Tonnes Climate Change and Green House Gases Emissions GRI Green House gas emissions and Sulphur dioxide pollution have reached hitherto unseen heights and focus on the environment has become even more important,Environmental
Organizations worldover have become more environmentconscious and shipping is no exception,Environmental
Apart from the existing Emission Control Areas that require ships to burn fuels which contain no more than Sulphur another global regulation that entered into force from January requires that the Sulphur content of marine fuel which is burnt in engines and boilers to be capped at,Environmental
The availability and quality of the low Sulphur fuel oil referred to as compliant fuel is one of the challenges that was expected to be faced by the industry in the year,Environmental
The other option being fitment of scrubber units on vessels besides being both technically and financially challenging is further in doubt as a suitable solution as these are designed to remove Sulphur pollution from the atmosphere and transfer the same as a pollutant to the seas,Environmental
Many ports have banned the use of openloop scrubbers because of the environmental risks associated with discharging the scrubber washwater into the ocean,Environmental
The washwater from openloop scrubbers contains high levels of pollutants including toxic chemicals and heavy metals which can harm marine life and the wider ecosystem,Environmental
The Company is committed to sustainable longterm measures to improve the environment and has therefore opted for operating the vessels with more expensive compliant fuels,Environmental
The vessels had prepared to operate with this compliant fuel by cleaning all fuel tanks sub dividing large fuel tanks into smaller tanks capable of handling smaller parcels of fuel without mixing using suitable additives and lubricants and conducting pre joining and onboard on the job training for the crew to meet these challenges,Environmental
In April the IMO adopted a resolution on the strategy of a reduction of total GHG emissions by as compared to the levels of the year,Environmental
This requires vessels to report annual fuel oil consumption worldwide to IMO through the flag administration,Environmental
This system is expected to generate reliable data to monitor and assess the progress of efforts to reduce the emission of GHGs,Environmental
All vessels have implemented both the EU MRV and IMO DCS and the data on fuel consumed and distances steamed during the year are reported to the IMO as well as the EU after verification by a Recognized Organization,Environmental
To formalize the Companys commitment towards preserving and conserving the environment and to reduce carbon footprint the Company completed the transition audit for ISO on August and received the new ISO certification from Class NK of Japan,Environmental
The ISO provides a framework for a holistic and strategic approach to the Companys environmental policy plans and ANNUAL REPORT Precious Shipping Public Company Limited actions and will demonstrate that the Company is an environmentally responsible organizaion and that all operations are conducted in an environmentally sustainable manner,Environmental

improved by retrofitting fuel saving devices like the Mewis Duct PreShrouded Vanes and Hub Vortex Absorbed Fins Further several older and less fuelefficient vessels of the fleet were replaced between the years ANNUAL REPORT Precious Shipping Public Company Limited to with Eco vessels,Environmental
Eco operation is made possible by larger cargo hauls reduced fuel consumption on account of better hull lines lower lightship and very efficient electronically controlled engines and optimized use of waste heat from the engines even the exhaust gases from the auxiliary engines is diverted through the boiler to use the available heat,Environmental
Our new Eco vessels emit approximately less CO per unit transport work as compared to the older vessels in the fleet,Environmental
At the same time the Company seriously evaluates all new developments carefully as several builders claims are often exaggerated to get fresh business and when technical parameters such as the calorific value of fuel design and scantling draft and sea margins are taken into consideration the socalled benefits simply do not exist or they are not costeffective,Environmental
In any event the Company looks very closely at the machinery on all new acquisitions whether new buildings or secondhand vessels and monitors their performance very carefully to arrive at optimum speed and consumption variables while ensuring that emissions are kept to a minimum,Environmental
We have made a substantial reduction in our carbon footprint and this is expected to improve further through optimization measures like shorter ballast passages and port stays larger cargo hauls and slower steaming,Environmental
In the year the average carbon intensity per transport work was estimated at Grams CO per Tonne Nautical Mile and in the year it was estimated at Grams CO per Tonne Nautical Mile which equates to a reduction of,Environmental
The Company is also a member of the Getting to Zero Coalition which aims to place zeroemission vessels in operations by,Social
As a member of the coalition the Company is carefully monitoring developments in technology in the Marine field which offer vessels that operate with zero emissions,Environmental
The range of sources of power with zero emissions is extensive but largely in the research stage,Environmental
The feverish pace of Green Technology aims to decarbonize Marine Transport by offering alternative lowcarbon and zerocarbon fuels like Biofuels Methanol Ammonia Hydrogen and innovative renewable energy options like Wind power solar power and Electric propulsion,Environmental
LNG is considered by many to be a transition fuel on the pathway to the zerocarbon future of the Shipping industry,Environmental
It has virtually no SOx and very low NOx emissions and as compared to fuel oil has almost a reduction is carbon dioxide emissions,Environmental
However LNG is mostly made up of Methane which is a highly potent GHG far more harmful to the environment than CO,Environmental
The use of LNG from well to wake involves a leakage of Methane to the atmosphere referred to as Methane slip,Environmental
It is estimated that for the same amount of emission Methane warms the planet times more in a short span of years as would CO in a hundred years,Environmental
Hence until a solution is found to address or substantially reduce Methane slip LNG cannot be considered a viable option to reduce GHGs,Environmental
The Companys commitment to the environment led to the early induction of ECO vessels,Environmental
Similarly it is expected that as soon as commercially viable options of these next generation zero emission green vessels become available they will also form part of our fleet,Environmental
Waste Management GRI Mitigation measures are used to manage planned waste reduce its impact on the environment and ensure compliance with applicable laws standards and policies,Environmental
The Company implemented the garbage management plan to treat waste generated onboard,Environmental
It is a requirement under the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships MARPOL for all ships operating in international waters,Environmental
The purpose of the plan is to minimize the amount of waste generated on board and to ensure that all waste is properly disposed of in order to reduce the risk of marine pollution and preserve the health of the oceans and coastal areas,Environmental
ANNUAL REPORT Precious Shipping Public Company Limited Food waste GRI IMO defines food waste as any spoiled or unspoiled food substances and includes fruits vegetables dairy products poultry meat products and food scraps generated onboard ship,Environmental
Food waste on board may be disposed of onshore or shredded by food waste disposer grinds food waste into small pieces and disposed of at sea beyond or nm from the nearest land,Environmental
To reduce pollution the Company continuously trains and updates crew members as well as onshore personnel on our policies and requirements for strict adherence to MARPOL and general environmental awareness,Environmental
The Company has set a goal of reducing food waste by within the year compared to a baseline year,Environmental
Description Food waste Cubic metrem GRI Some practices have implemented to reduce food waste onboard a ship Meal planning Plan meals carefully taking into account the number of crew members their dietary needs and the amount of food available,Environmental
Portion control Serve appropriate portions to avoid overserving and reduce waste,Environmental
Proper storage Store food properly to extend its shelf life and reduce spoilage,Social
Inventory management Keep track of food inventory to avoid overstocking and reduce waste,Environmental
Food waste digester Use of a food waste digester can help to break down food waste and reduce its volume,Environmental
Sludge disposal GRI Another source of harmful substances generated by our ships consumption of fuel and diesel oil is sludge,Environmental
Sludge is a product of on board fuel oil purification and as an alternative to incinerating sludge and releasing even more harmful gasses into the environment the Company has made a substantial effort to dispose of such material to shorebased reception facilities,Environmental
This is a much more expensive way for dealing with this issue but the Company is committed to reducing its carbon footprint and reflects the Companys efforts towards environmental conservation,Environmental
Waste oil or sludge generated on each ship is about of all fuel burnt,Environmental
Empirical research suggests that every ton of oil burnt generates approximately tons of CO,Environmental
By delivering sludge to a suitable reception facility this waste can be recycled to make products like grease which is a lubricant widely used in multiple industries,Environmental
To reduce CO emission from incinerators the Company intended to deliver more sludge disposal ashore,Environmental
Description Sludge disposed of ashore Cubic metrem GRI Green Procurement and Using Resource Efficiency Green procurement refers to the process of acquiring goods and services in an environmentally responsible manner,Environmental
Following are the practices we adopted to promote green procurement Promote the use of products from recycled materials products with energyefficient features or products with certifications for environmental sustainability,Environmental
Assessing suppliers based on their environmental practices and selecting suppliers that have a strong commitment to sustainability,Environmental

Monitor and evaluate the performance of suppliers and the impact of procurement decisions on the environment and continuously improve practices to reduce environmental impact,Environmental
The Company encourages optimal use of resources at the office by using byproducts and ecofriendly materials ie recycled paper reusing paper that has only been printed on one side encouraging the use of reusable bags and containers to avoid the use of singleuse plastic supporting our staff to learn and understand how to optimize resource consumption to promote environmental preservation and proper consumption behavior We are pleased to report that the Company presents this Annual Report in a,Environmental
digital form and if at all a printed version is required it is printed on recycled paper,Environmental
This is our token contribution to the conservation of the natural environment and in line with our stated desire to reduce our carbon footprint,Environmental
Marine Mammals Protection GRI A What dangers do marine mammals face from international shipping,Social
Life for a marine mammal in todays world is tough,Social
Many of the struggles that marine mammals face is sadly due to human negligence and interference,Social
The three biggest threats marine mammals face from international shipping are Ship Strikes Fastmoving ships can collide with marine mammals causing injury or death,Social
To illustrate ship strikes have been identified as the number one reason for the disappearance of the North Atlantic Right Whale,Social
The Right Whale is only one of many marine mammal species that are at risk of being hit by highspeed ships,Environmental
It is estimated that over manatees die prematurely due to ship strikes every year in Florida,Social
Acoustic Pollution Loud noises from ships sonar drilling rigs and other human sources can interfere with the ability of marine mammals to communicate find food mate and navigate,Environmental
Scientists believe that acoustic noise pollution prevents these mammals from being able to detect approaching ships or fishing nets adding to the risk of being killed,Environmental
ANNUAL REPORT Precious Shipping Public Company Limited Oil Spills Oil spills have both shortterm and longterm effects on marine mammals,Environmental
Animals like seals and otters that are exposed to oil will automatically try and lick the oil off their fur,Environmental
Toxic chemicals in oil cause serious damage to the digestive system and internal organs,Environmental
Thick sticky oil has also been shown to clog the blowholes of dolphins and whales causing them to suffocate,Environmental
In the long term exposure to petroleum can cause reproductive damage making it difficult for populations to repopulate in the wake of oil spills,Environmental
Otter populations are only just starting to come back after the ExxonValdez spill,Environmental
B What species are most in danger,Environmental
An Atrisk species is one in which the population viability is at risk due to ship strikes,Environmental
Viability may be influenced by a number of single or interacting factors including the proportion of a population in high risk areas populations that are prone to ship strikes for species that swim slowly or remain at surface for long periods of time sperm whales humpback whales bowhead whales and right whales or for populations that have a small number of reproductively mature females eg,Social
