Global Coal Market Demand for imported coal in contracted sharply due to lockdown measures in countries worldwide to control the outbreak of Coronavirus COVID,Social
There have been restrictions on social activities nonessential travel and business activities,Social
As a result gasfired power plants increase their operations while coalfired power generation was reduced dragging down coal consumption especially in Europe,Environmental
The Peoples Republic of China remained the worlds largest coal importer despite its governments move to limit imports to protect domestic coal business,Environmental
The impact of the COVID pandemic on China since the beginning of the year had reduced the countrys coal demand while government measures against the outbreak lowered coal production even further,Environmental
Moreover imported coal was far cheaper than domestic coal leading to a huge volume of coal imports in the first half of,Environmental
The Chinese government had tried to revive the countrys economy since midFebruary however the public still mostly avoided economic activities resulting in a slow recovery,Social
Since May electricity demand had rebounded to its precrisis level driven by hot weather and lower hydropower production capacity,Environmental
The coalfired power plants production was also back at the level prior to the COVID crisis,Environmental
Several coal mining accidents in China led the Chinese government to enforce mine safety regulations,Social
ChinaAustralia trade disputes have been continuing since last year,Social
Just before the end of China therefore tightened its restrictions by imposing a ban on coal imports from Australia and asked importers to stop importing Australian coal,Environmental
In Indian coal imports also contracted due to its governments lockdown measures between late March and May to curb the spread of COVID,Environmental
A dramatic drop in electricity demand during the lockdown caused demand for coal to shrink,Environmental
However coal production did not suffer much as it The word coal in this section of report refers to thermal coal Banpu Public Company Limited was an essential activity exempted from the measures leading to an oversupply of domestic coal,Environmental
Yet there was a demand for imported coal from coalfired power plants that are distant from coal sources,Environmental
Likewise the steel and cement industries preferred imported coal with a high calorific value especially the cement producers who turned to coal as a replacement for expensive petroleum coke,Environmental
In India economy picked up slowly because Covid infection rates remained high stagnating the demand for imported coal,Environmental
Coal imports in the Republic of Korea South Korea fell in early as the government restricted coalfired power generation from December to March to reduce air pollution,Environmental
Besides there was an increase in nuclear power generation,Environmental
In May South Korea announced lockdown measures to stop the COVID dragging down electricity demand to the lowest level in five years,Environmental
Lower LNG prices enabled LNG power plants to compete with coalfired plants,Environmental
Consequently the cost of electricity from coalfired plants became lower than that from gasfired plants,Environmental
Nevertheless in December since the government restricted coalfired power generation consumption of imported coal fell sharply in the past year,Environmental
Taiwan announced lockdown measures to prevent the spread of COVID fairly early,Environmental
So the country was mildly affected by the COVID and its economy rebounded to the precrisis level relatively quickly,Social
Vietnam saw commercial commencement of new coalfired power plants as its electricity demand Annual Report increased while domestic coal production slowed down,Environmental
Vietnam was not much affected by COVID because the government had declared preventive measures fairly early,Social
Most Southeast Asian countries also imported more coal despite economic contrac tion except the Philippines which imported less coal as a result of strict lockdown measures,Environmental
The Islamic Republic of Pakistan saw an increase in coal imports despite the enforced lockdown measures as a new coalfired power plant commenced commercial operations at the end of the year,Environmental
In coal imports in the European market plummeted due to falling electricity demand caused by lockdown measures to control the spread of COVID,Environmental
Recordlow natural gas prices and a steady increase in power generation from renewable sources lowered the demand for coal,Environmental
Besides many European countries have accelerated their plans to phaseout coal use in power plants to meet their greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets,Environmental
Many countries set a target to end coal use in power generation by which will result in a significant drop in European coal consumption,Environmental
Australias coal exports also dropped driven by trade disputes with China leading to Chinas ban on imports of Australian coal,Environmental
Apart from that coal producers had to comply with the governments COVID control measures,Environmental
These have caused Colombian coal export volume to drop significantly making it the country that suffered most from the slump in coal exports after Indonesia,Environmental
At the end of South Africa benefited from Chinas ban on imports of Australian coal as more Chinese buyers turned to South Africa for coal imports,Environmental
According to its Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources Indonesian coal production in totaled million tonnes decreasing by from the previous year,Environmental
Nonetheless coal production was only slightly affected given coal being a primary commodity exempted from the governments COVID control measures,Environmental
According to Indonesias Customs Department coal exports in the first ten months of were at million tonnes falling as much as yearonyear,Environmental
