Successful business strategies for the mass transit business rely on decision and implementation made by the government relating to the national mass transit system expansion plan our ability to retain and assess business partners possible investment financial support concession granting and control on our finance and operations as well as factors out of our control such as politics,Social
As such in order to ensure appropriate business strategies BTS Group carries out regular determination and reviews thereof taking into account and paying close attention to political development and changes in government policies,Governance
BTS Group has procured an appropriate risk management system for each business unit to implement guidelines on risk management to handle possible risk,Governance
