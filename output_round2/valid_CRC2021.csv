Laws and legal instruments used for economy control are still in the beginning stage of development and its foundation is still not as strong as the developed markets,Social
Vietnams laws are still lack of development consistency or clarity,Social
Practically since the public sectors are usually responsible for operations regarding laws and regulations and determination of the legal correctness and enforcement instead of the court it is hard to estimate when Vietnams legal system would be developed to be as clear and certain as the countries with developed legal system,Social
