In February the tension between Russia and Ukraine escalated as Western countries imposed economic sanctions on Russia including a ban on Russian coal imports,Social
The ban disrupted the supply chain and caused global coal prices to reach record highs,Environmental
Despite extremely high prices the cost to generate electricity from coal was much lower than that from natural gas due to a price surge as Russia reduced natural gas exports to Europe,Environmental
The uncertainties surrounding the natural gas supply from Russia have made Europe more dependent on coal,Environmental
This prompted more coal buying for the winter further tightening the supply of highquality coal,Environmental
The UK allowed Russian coal imports until the end of before the coal import ban came into force in early,Environmental
However the coalfired power plants in UK have been retired and although the retirement of some of the remaining coalfired power plants was delayed coal consumption only increased slightly,Environmental
Japan also joined the international sanctions on Russian coal by gradually phasing out coal imports from Russia,Environmental
The country still allowed its coal buyers who already had purchase agreements with Russia to continue importing coal according to their active agreements,Environmental
However some coal importers voluntarily stopped importing coal from Russia and switched to buy coal from other sources,Environmental
In addition Japans coal consumption began to recover after being impacted by the COVID pandemic last year leading to a tight supply of highquality coal,Environmental
Total Supply South Korea did not impose sanctions against Russia and allowed coal users to import coal from Russia,Social
Although the governments coalfired power plants removed Russian coal from tender documents they still bought coal from Russia through coal traders registered outside Russia because Russian coal is much cheaper than coal from other sources,Environmental
The South Korean government had to lift restrictions on the operation of coalfired power plants to reduce electricity costs prompting more coalfired power plants to resume operation,Environmental
between coalfired power plants and producers is set at CNY per tonne which was the FOB price in North China ports,Environmental
In addition there were efforts to encourage coalfired power plants to enter into coal purchase agreements with producers to cover their total demand,Environmental
In the meantime the Chinese government tried to motivate coal producers to scale up production so that there was enough coal stock for consumption a critical factor that helped stabilize coal prices in China,Environmental
The Chinese government loosened almost all COVID control measures on December and shifted focus to economic growth,Social
Unfortunately the COVID cases escalated rapidly after easing restrictions causing a shortterm economic slowdown but a positive effect in the long term because it created herd immunity in the country and helped the economy recover faster than maintaining the zeroCOVID policy,Social
In the Republic of Indias coal imports increased as its economy recovered after suffering COVID in the previous year,Environmental
Summers heatwaves coupled with domestic coal supply shortage pushed coal imports for coalfired power plants to rise despite high global coal prices,Environmental
Therefore the Indian government allowed power plants run on imported coal to add the cost onto the electricity bill which helped ramp up power plants operations,Environmental
Some Southeast and South Asian countries delayed coal imports in due to soaring prices prompting many factories to turn to lowgrade coal to reduce costs,Environmental
Other factories cut back on production because they could not afford costly coal,Environmental
But the supply of highquality coal became tightened after several countries imposed sanctions on Russian coal,Environmental
Australias coal exports dropped significantly due to severe rainfall almost all year round from the influence of La Nina leading to flooding that suspended production at coal mines and disrupted railway transportation,Environmental
Taiwan did not officially join the sanctions on Russia but its coalfired power plants have stopped importing Russian coal since mid,Environmental
Meanwhile Taiwans private sector continued to import Russian coal because of its low price compared to other energy sources,Environmental
Chinas coal imports in fell drastically due to the COVID outbreak at the beginning of the year forcing the Chinese government to announce lockdowns in many cities from the end of Q to Q following its zeroCOVID policy,Social
But after the Chinese government began easing lockdowns at the end of Q the economy started to recover prompting electricity and coal demands to increase,Environmental
As the early summer approached the electricity demand for cooling increased and propelled coal demand to increase accordingly,Environmental
Nevertheless strict COVID control measures severely affected coal production and transportation in China,Environmental
The transportation sector suffered more than the production sector due to travel restrictions to curb the spread of COVID,Social
Later in the rainy season heavy rainfalls flooded coal mining sites causing coal supply to recover slower than coal demand,Environmental

Heavy rains and several protests hardhit Colombias coal exports,Environmental
In addition the new Colombian government elected at the end of has the policy to reduce coal production and exports while no longer approving the development of new coal mines,Environmental
Nevertheless European buyers and Russian sellers had been trying to accelerate coal delivery to Europe before the ban on Russian coal imports took effect on August,Environmental
Concurrently Russian coal producers attempted to export more coal to Asia,Environmental
Still with limited rail transport capacity from mines to Pacific ports it was not viable to increase the significant amount of coal exports to Asia by this route,Environmental
Moreover Banpu could sell coal to Europe after sanctions on Russian coal prompted Europe to buy coal from other sources instead,Environmental
The Indonesian government revised the Domestic Market Obligation DMO regulation to closely monitor mine compliance using an online system,Social
Mines with purchase agreements with domestic consumers especially power plants must input the information into the system to track monthly coal transports from mines to consumers,Environmental
Those mines that do not have purchase agreements with domestic consumers are required to pay compensation to the government instead,Social
Most of the increased coal was lowquality coal,Environmental
Most exported coal is of medium to low quality with huge discounts compared to highquality coal making it attractive for buyers,Environmental

Coal Market in Thailand During the first ten months of total coal consumption of the private sector in Thailand was approximately million tonnes rising million tonnes or yearonyear,Environmental
However the use of coal for power generation increased because the cost of coal for power generation remained low compared to other fuels,Environmental
Coal consumption by independent power producers IPP and small power producers SPP rose to and million tonnes respectively up and yearonyear,Environmental
Coal consumption from other industries such as paper petrochemicals textiles and food was about million tonnes rising yearonyear,Environmental
This group also includes some coal users in Taiwan who voluntarily stopped importing Russian coal and therefore bought coal from other sources instead most of which was highquality coal,Environmental
However the Western ban on Russian access to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications SWIFT affected many countries as they needed help in making payments for coal from Russia and insurance,Social
In addition China and India have established an alternative payment system directly with Russia in local currency,Social
As it was not necessary to rely on the Western countries international money transfer system many countries in this group imported more coal from Russia,Social
In early the Indonesian government banned coal exports while coal demand in many countries began to recover after they relaxed the COVID control measures,Environmental
In Q there was an outbreak of COVID in China prompting the government to impose a lockdown in many provinces,Social
So the demand for medium and lowquality coal dropped significantly,Environmental
Coal demand began to recover in the middle of Q after the Chinese government eased the restrictions,Environmental
Overall global coal imports in totaled about million tonnes decreasing around million tonnes yearonyear or,Environmental
Despite the impact of the COVID pandemic which caused coal imports in to fall to about million tonnes from a year earlier China remained the worlds largest coal importer thanks to its high demand,Environmental
At the same time coal production and transportation had been affected by the COVID control measures forcing China to rely on imported coal,Environmental
In India imported about million tonnes of coal an increase over the previous year when the country was affected by the COVID pandemic,Environmental
Most of Indias coal imports were medium and lowquality coal with abundant supply,Environmental
As Russian coal was a cheaper alternative in this market there was a sharp rise in coal imports from Russia,Environmental
Greece Portugal Source Marketing Sales and Logistics analyst Banpu Plc Million Tonnes ONE REPORT Global coal exports in were at approximately million tonnes increasing from the previous year due to the rerouting of coal shipments following the EUs sanctions on Russian coal adding greater distances and shipping time,Environmental
Indonesian coal producers were able to increase their output significantly despite heavy rainfall,Environmental
The country had been impacted by La Nina which caused heavy rainfalls almost all year round hindering coal production and transportation,Environmental
North Asian countries namely Japan South Korea and Taiwan imported approximately million tonnes of coal increasing yearonyear,Environmental
Factors contributing to more coal consumption were the high price of liquefied natural gas LNG and nuclear power plant outages thus requiring coalfired power plants to increase operations,Environmental
Another submarket is for lowcalorific coal in which the competition was more intense due to abundant supply,Environmental
The competition therefore became more intense as there were multiple sellers while most consumers were flexible about the quality of coal,Environmental
Transportation of Russian natural gas to Europe was disrupted prompting European countries to reactivate coalfired power plants and delay their coal retirement to stabilize the power systems,Environmental
were at approximately million tonnes decreasing over the past year owing to Western sanctions,Environmental
Some coal producers who had no access to rail transport had to unload coal at western ports then used liners to transport coal to Asia incurring a prohibitive freight cost owing to the long distance,Environmental
However the highquality coal market was less Coal prices in were highly volatile due to many factors including geopolitical tensions the pandemic and climate,Environmental
Colombia is closer to Europe than other coalproducing countries thus the transportation costs are lower making Colombian coal attractive to European buyers,Environmental
In imported coal demand is set to increase over as the EuropeRussia conflict continues,Environmental
The conflict will put the procurement of natural gas in Europe at risk and the prices of natural gas and liquefied natural gas LNG will remain elevated which will promote the use of coal a cheaper alternative in power generation,Environmental
Coal is expected to be in higher demand for energy stability as many European countries have reactivated retired coalfired power plants and delayed phasing out of coalfired power plants,Environmental
Coal is still a cheap fuel option for developing countries being threatened by economic crises and inflation,Environmental
However the ongoing conflict between Europe and Russia coupled with the EUs ban on Russian coal imports will split the global coal market into two parts and continue to tighten the supply of highcalorific coal,Environmental
It also expanded exports into Europe to meet the rising demand driven by the energy crisis following the EUs sanctions on Russian coal imports,Environmental
Improving the Quality of Coal Banpu improved the quality of coal from its Indonesian mines by using the Resource Optimization application to determine the optimum blending ratio of coal from different mines to get the blends that meet the target markets requirements,Environmental
Maintaining Customer Relations Banpu values longterm relationships with customers and trade partners through its employees,Social
In early the Company maintained customer relationships through phone calls and online meetings because some countries still imposed travel restrictions to curb COVID spread,Social
Around yearend when COVID preventive measures were eased in many countries the Company sent out its employees to visit customers to learn about their problems and obstacles,Social
This helped the Company to understand the challenges facing customers both the COVID pandemic and the impacts of the RussiaUkraine conflict,Social
The Company continued sending emails to customers and stakeholders every quarter to inform them of the Companys performance to ensure that it can fulfill delivery commitments amid the pandemic and the economic consequences of the RussiaUkraine conflict,Social
Part of the supply is to be blended with the Companys coal to improve quality,Environmental
