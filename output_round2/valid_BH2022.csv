missions and values and that they remained efficient and reflected the Companys operation standards,Social
The Board consists of directors of whom five are independent,Governance
This accounts for of the entire board members which is still lower than the threshold,Governance
Yet this ratio of independent directors expresses an appropriate checkandbalance momentum since the number accounts for no less than onethird of the entire board members and there are no fewer than three independent directors,Governance
These directors also have independent quality as specified in the criteria of the Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Stock Exchange of Thailand,Governance
Chairman of the Board is not an independent director,Governance
However Chairman of the Board and Managing Director is not the same person,Governance
The division of their duties is clear,Governance
Chairman of the Board can effectively perform hisher duty,Governance
The Company has three independent directors who have been in the office for more than nine consecutive years namely Ms Sophavadee Uttamobol Mr Prin Chirathivat and Ms Aruni Kettratad,Governance
The average term of office of these three directors is years,Governance
However the three independent directors are knowledgeable and competent and they thoroughly understand the nature of the Companys business,Governance

Yet such quality aligns with the law and also adds flexibility to an urgent meeting,Social
Besides in practice Chairman of the Board makes sure that every director must attend more than of all Board meetings each year,Governance
As a result the quorum of the Board when adopting a resolution always encompasses no fewer than twothirds of the entire board members,Governance
This is because all bodies work together without divisiveness,Social
Subcommittees and the management thoroughly screen issues under their responsibility before reporting to the Board for joint consideration,Governance
As such the way they work consider and make a decision is done as an entire team with joint responsibility,Social
In this regard the evaluation of the entire board is enough to reflect and measure the performance of the Board each individual board member every subcommittee and the management as reflected through the Companys annual performance,Governance
The Nomination and Remuneration Committee NRC consists of a chairman who is an independent director,Governance
Since the remaining two are not independent directors the entire NRC therefore cannot be considered to consist of a majority of independent directors,Governance
However the ratio of independent directorship in the NRC is already appropriate because its management is based on the CG Code,Governance
The NRCs policy is to have a meeting at least twice a year which reflects the CG policy and its practicality,Governance
The Company does not appoint a CG Committee,Governance
Yet it has departments that are responsible for every matter in this area including the Legal Department the Internal Audit Department and the Company Secretary,Governance
Besides it provides channels for stakeholders to file complaints which is adequate for its internal control system and for efficient supervision under the CG,Governance
