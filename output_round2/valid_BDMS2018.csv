Furthermore the Company has access to other international platforms and social media that have numerous users and we have continuously provided interesting and benecial content,Social
New Market China In the past year tourism in Thailand has been very prominent and has continued to receive great interest from foreign patients especially Chinese patients,Social

November signed the Memorandum of Understanding with Ping An Good Doctor Chinas leading online onestop medical and wellness platform with over million users to jointly provide a new choice in healthcare online medical a dvice and a channel to recommend more Chinese patients to come to Thailand for treatment at BDMS network hospitals,Social
BDMS uses digital media and platforms to communicate for convenient access to general health information Product Procurement Medical Personnel The Company has the policy to recruit physicians that are experts in each eld as well as nurses and other medical personnel in order to provide quality service that covers all areas,Social
Such recruitment is carried out for all companies within the group,Social
The recruitment of physicians and nurses is conducted by selecting candidates from leading medical and nursing schools,Social
Each of the physicians and nurses is then selected for employment by the Medical Committee of the respective hospital,Social
As medical personnel are essential to the Companys hospital business and in order for medical personnel to develop their knowledge and medical advancement techniques both in terms of profession and technology the Company supports medical research and academic conferences,Social
The Company also organizes continuous training for physicians and nurses to develop medical knowledge of related personnel,Social
This includes training for nurses so that they have expertise in providing patient care prior to starting work,Social
Furthermore the Company recognizes the importance of investments in medical technology medical tools and equipment which can indirectly attract capable and expert medical personnel to remain with the hospital for a longer period of time,Social
Such technology and equipment also help to foster experiences and skills in medical diagnoses and treatment,Social
This process of purchasing medicine and medical supplies ensures the highest efciency in managing procurement and inventory within the group which includes the suitability of prices as well as efciency and quality of medicine and medical supplies,Social
Procurement of Medical Equipment As medical equipment and tools are important factors in providing quality and efcient medical services to the patients the procurement of medical equipment and tools within the Company and network hospitals is therefore delegated to the Medical Committee for the Procurement of Medical Equipment,Social
This Medical Committee shall carefully consider the necessity and the required quality of the medical equipment and tools to suit the needs of the hospital group,Social
In addition for network hospitals to ensure that patients receive quality and efcient medical services the Company has made certain that hospitals within the network especially those in the regional areas are equipped with modern medical equipment,Social
The basic medical equipment that all hospitals should have are MRI CT Scan and Cath Lab,Social
Apart from being able to provide medical services to patients at the hospitals within the network such equipment can also be of use to medical centers or clinics in the surrounding areas as well as being able to accommodate patient referrals from other medical centers or clinics,Social

While private investment has gradually expanded exports will show a decline in line with the global economy which is an effect from the US trade sanctions against China,Social
Even though health care is one of the four requisites of life the state of the economy can impact purchasing power and patrons of private hospitals may choose to delay or lessen visits to the hospitals such as delay of treatment postponement of visits for elective procedures shortening hospital stays and decreasing medical costs by visiting public hospitals or less costly private hospitals,Social
The Company has the strategy to expand the hospital network to various provinces that have potential and are in need of private hospitals to encompass all regions,Social
Operational Risks Risk from government measures On January the Cabinet approved price control of medicine and medical services as proposed by the Ministry of Commerce,Social
The Cabinet also approved the setting up of a subcommittee comprised of the Ministry of Commerce the Ministry of Public Health representatives of the public sector and representatives of public and private health care providers,Social
In addition the Company has made preparations in anticipation of any requests for information from related organizations as well as determined appropriate supportive measures,Social
The enforcement of laws or new regulations as well as the deliberation of the draft Patient Protection Act which aims to protect persons who have been wronged or received damages from health care services with the goal to compensate the patients in a timely manner without having to prove wrongdoing may affect health care providers including the Company,Social
There is Risk Factors also consideration of setting up a patient protection fund to pay for damages to patients whereby the health care clinics including the Company as a health care business operator are responsible for contributing to the fund according to the rules procedures and rate determined by the Patient Protection Committee,Social
Nevertheless the Company and network hospitals are in compliance with various standards of quality such as JCI Joint Commission International and HA Hospital Accreditation,Social
Compliance with HA requires that a Committee be established to monitor the quality of patient care and ensure that it meets the standards of safety and environmental conservation as well as monitor the various risks especially risk in providing medical care,Social
This may help to lessen the effects of changes to laws regarding health and the environment,Environmental
Public hospitals have also expanded medical services offered such as opening afterhours clinics and private hospitals managed by large public hospitals which may draw away some of our patients,Social
Therefore to increase servicing efciency and competitive edge the Company pays close attention to patient referral as well as hub and spoke hospital management,Social
In each region the Company has hub hospitals which have the capability to provide complex treatment while the spoke hospitals are smaller than the hub hospitals and will provide convenience and an alternative for patients in the surrounding areas and transfer patients to the hub hospitals for more complex treatment,Social
Furthermore the Company manages shared services of the central medical laboratories central procurement central accounting and central information technology,Social
Risk in retaining medical personnel or key executives The private hospital business must depend on skilled medical personnel such as physicians nurses pharmacists and technicians,Social
Presently the hospital business in Thailand is faced with the problem of lack of medical personnel,Social
Great reliance is placed upon the public sector to develop medical personnel and there have not been sufcient medical personnel to meet demand,Social
However BDMS is a large network of hospitals and has continued to provide nancial support for education and research to medical personnel in order to improve specialized skills,Social
We are a knowledge organization that aims to enhance medical knowledge in all areas as well as provide stateoftheart medical technology,Social
Legal Risk Presently people are more aware of patients rights especially with the issuance of the Act on Court Proceedings for Consumer Cases BE,Social
which more easily enables consumers and patients to le suit against health care service providers,Social
This law may affect health care service providers and medical personnel which puts the Company at risk of being sued for medical services provided,Social
Nevertheless management recognizes the importance of controlling and inspecting quality of medical services the screening of physicians as well as respecting patients rights,Social
The Company gives importance to providing information managing patients expectations reporting procedures and nding solutions when a complaint is received as well as improving quality and determining indicators that ensure that the quality of service always meets international standards in order to lessen such risks,Social
Currently there is one law suit from a former member of the Life Privilege Project,Social
This group of patrons chooses to come to Thailand for health care services because of the internationally recognized standards and quality of medical services reasonable medical fees and Thailands renowned tourism industry,Social
Therefore the Company faces risk from various crises that will affect patients condence in coming to Thailand for health care services which is out of the Companys control such as domestic politics as well as various natural disasters and increased competition,Social
All these factors will directly affect the number of foreign patients that will come to Thailand for medical services,Social
Thus the Company has a policy to diversify and reduce this risk by expanding the hospital network to other provinces across the country which have potential and are in need of medical services,Social
In addition the Company has expanded the foreign patient base to cover more diverse countries to reduce the concentration risk of patients in any one group,Social
Ltd has invested in NHealth Cambodia Co Ltd and NHealth Myanmar with and ownership respectively to provide central lab work,Social
The Committee meets regularly to review and determine measures to manage the risk as well as nd appropriate solutions for the Company and patients when there is default of payment,Governance
Therefore the economic status of the country of origin of the foreign patients has an impact on the number of foreigners who visit hospitals within the Companys network in the same way that the domestic economy impacts the number of local patients,Social
When providing services to patients who are personally responsible for the expense the Company has the policy to assess the expense before providing medical services so that the patient will be aware of the budget and make payment or a deposit prior to treatment,Social
