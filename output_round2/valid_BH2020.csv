Governance Internal Control and Risk Management Related Party Transaction Corporate Social Responsibility Chai Sophonpanich Chairman of the Board In Bumrungrad International Hospi tal witnessed two seminal moments in its history,Governance
We celebrated our th anniversary in commemoration of our proud commitment to the community and our dedication to providing worldclass care to our patients throughout the globe,Social
Secondly were navigating through a glob al pandemic the likes of which havent been witnessed in over years,Social
COVID emerged and quickly spread to almost every country around the world including Thailand,Social
Our th year of operation was therefore dominated by the significant challenges of running the business during a global pandemic,Social
Despite strong measures by the Thai government to protect public health and rehabilitate the economy international travel restrictions had a devastating effect on many businesses,Social
With tourists foreign patients and businesspeople unable to travel overseas Thailands hotels restaurants shopping malls and private hospitals suffered significantly,Social
Prior to approximately of Bumrungrad International Hospitals annual income came from overseas patients,Social
Consequently the hospitals strategy was revised to reduce reliance on these patient groups,Social
During the second half of the Thai government relaxed control measures and allowed foreign patients to enter the country for medical treatment,Social
Nevertheless the situation remains challenging in many regions that are home to our overseas patients especially the Middle East CLMV countries and the USA,Social
The hospitals focus therefore shifted to domestic target groups including Thais and foreign residents in Thailand,Social
Yet even among these groups there were challenges including the slowdown in domestic purchasing power and public concern about the local COVID outbreak at yearend,Social
To adapt to these fastchanging circumstances Bumrungrad continuously reviewed and acted decisively,Social
We however did not stray our values on which this hospital was founded,Social
We found inspiration from our values of being agile innovative and caring,Social
A few examples of these increasing our investments in advanced technology and equipment to provide the best infection prevention and control measures and to enhance treatment results,Social
To adapt to changing patient behavior the hospital offered additional services and promotions while driving even greater efficiency in the management of service areas,Social
Health and wellness goals were fully integrated into holistic medical care treating and promoting health and we maintained close contact with patients,Social
In gratitude for their support we pledged a price freeze on the occasion of our th anniversary,Social
While the global COVID situation may not yet have eased I am confident that Bumrungrad will continue to successfully navigate the resulting challenges and maintain its leadership of Thailands private hospital sector,Social
As always our unwavering commitment to the highest quality and safety standards is at the heart of everything we do,Social
We continue to develop Bumrungrads status as a quaternary hospital offering eight centers of excellence and three critical care units,Social
We also continue our relentless focus on advanced medical technology and innovation,Social
In addition we are expanding our focus on wellness with the launch of VitallifeBangkrachao at the worldclass medical and wellness resort RAKxa,Social
I would like to thank our investors the Board of Directors and hospital management team I would also like to thank business partners everywhere as well as government agencies that have supported hospital operations during these difficult times,Social
Finally I extend my gratitude to all of the doctors dentists nurses pharmacists multidisciplinary professionals and support staff at Bumrungrad International Hospital,Social
During this challenging year many of them made significant personal sacrifices to ensure that the hospital continued to provide the highest standards of care for patients,Social
For Bumrungrad the year was challenging indeed as our th anniversary coincided with the COVID pandemic,Social
Reflecting on the past we have successfully navigated other challenges from the Asian financial crisis in to the subsequent outbreaks of SARS HN and MERS viruses,Social
COVID was the most acute challenge we have faced thus far when broad travel restrictions were enacted by the government to control the spread of the virus and fear permeated domestic sentiment,Social
In the past it was in fact Bumrungrad which detected the first case of MERS in Thailand and thereby curbed the local spread of the infection,Environmental
Our rigorous screening measures gained praise from the World Health Organization as well as the Thai Ministry of Public Health,Social
Drawing on decades of experience and commitment to clinical and operational excellence we have successfully navigated these troubled waters in,Social
In the first quarter we began offering direct teleconsultations and homecare services through our BumrungradHome service to our patients making it easier and more comfortable for patients to connect with our doctors to receive medications vaccinations and specimen collections,Social
This channel allows patients who trust in and demand Bumrungradquality services but who cannot or are reluctant to physically receive care to be served,Social
To improve the speed at which we render care we launched the drive thru second clinic offering vaccinations medicine pickups and blood draws within that time and established a new Preventive Genomics Family Checkup Services center staying at the forefront of advanced medical intervention through genetic testing and consultations to identify and help patients mitigate the risk of hereditary disease and drug allergies,Social
Linda Lisahapanya Managing Director We were undeterred by the difficulties of providing care to our overseas patients who continued to express desire to come to Bumrungrad,Social
We endeavored to connect with our international patients where possible,Social
An exemplification of our commitment to our patients overseas saw two Bumrungrad Relief Flights being arranged which chartered aircraft to transport patients and their companions safely into Thailand from Myanmar,Social
Moreover we especially outfitted a van to provide safetycompliant and comfortable transport for patients travelling overland from Cambodia and Laos,Social
We also offered Alternative State Quarantine ASQ services for overseas travelers to quarantine at partner hotels and Alternative Hospital Quarantine AHQ services at the hospital where patients can receive care under strict protocols and measures,Social
As the psychological impact of isolation and restricted movement under quarantine can often be daunting or distressing we committed resources and technology to enhance their experience and mitigate the effects of temporary social isolation,Social
It is this patientcentric and patientsafety approach that is at the core of everything we do,Social
Every day we have a waiting list of up to overseas patients who are applying for permission from the government to come to Bumrungrad for their care,Social
Not only did we keep our patients informed of measures to ensure their safety but we also communicated with the Thai public to help promote understanding of the pandemic and how to better protect themselves,Social
The app allows patients to seamlessly book adjust or review appointments to view content purchase the latest promotions or packages and to be enrolled in our loyalty card program,Social
We envision the app as the platform through which additional services and where ones health and wellbeing can be managed,Social
Mutually beneficial partnerships are a channel we will increasingly nurture,Social
During the year we opened Centers of Excellence for joint and spine surgeries with partner hospitals under the Bumrungrad Health Network,Social
We see significant expansion opportunities offering similar services to other networked hospitals and in other specialties such as cancer in the coming years,Social
Bumrungrad partnered with Central Groups The Card in order to offer our patients the ability to earn and burn points when paying for our services,Social
This collaborative model has generated new patient registrations and encouraged spending in a challenging economic time,Social
We also adjusted or accelerated projects or new services as patient needs evolved,Social
New services allowed patients to seek treatment and advice remotely,Social
To accommodate different patient needs a wide range of over health packages are now available online including the promotional health checkup packages as part of our th Anniversary Campaign,Social
Other new services include our Preventive Genomics Family Checkup Services Center which offers genetic testing to identify and mitigate the risk of hereditary disease and drug allergies,Social
Our subsidiary the Vitallife Scientific Wellness Center also expanded its offering in,Social
With the aim of providing worldclass holistic healthcare we launched Vitallife Bang Krachao at RAKxa a medical and wellness retreat located among lush greenery nestled between the bend of the Chao Phraya river in Bang Krachao island,Social
We believe RAKxa particularly when unrestricted travel is restored will be a goto regional wellness destination,Social
In conclusion I would like to express my sincere thanks to our shareholders Board of Directors physicians and clinicians dentists staff and management for their support over this past year,Social
In particular I thank all the frontline staff and doctors who have continued to provide the highest standard of treatment and care throughout the pandemic,Social

The Ulaanbaatar Songdo Hospital in Mongolia Ulaanbaatar Songdo is one of the leading private hospitals in Mongolia,Social
The outbreak has shaken consumer confidence in all outdoor activities and has compelled governments to restrict activities and travel at varying degrees and at disparate points throughout the year,Social
Both Thai and foreign residents decided to postpone or cancel their appointments in nonurgent cases due to safety concerns and fear of getting infected when outside of home,Social
At the same time patients overseas businesspeople and medical tourists could not travel into the country after the governments announcement of the Emergency Decree on Public Administration in the Situation of Emergency BE,Social
to control the COVID pandemic effective from March,Social
Since July these restrictions were eased allowing certain permitted groups entry but inbound travelers were required to undergo quarantine under all circumstances,Social
The abovementioned and consequent sharp drop in patient volumes prompted private hospitals to quickly adjust themselves in response primarily in enhancing screening sanitization and safety measures focusing on domestic business and promotions offering telemedicine and home care services,Social
The subsequent easing of travel restrictions and the governments readiness to support business activity whilst keeping residents safe germinated into offering Alternative State Quarantine ASQ in partnership with hotels where quarantined persons reside during the required minimum quarantine period of days Annual Report and Alternative Hospital Quarantine AHQ services where quarantined persons reside in hospitals and receive treatment,Social
Persons wishing to use ASQ and AHQ services are required to meet a number of criteria that includes health insurance or funding to support their cost of treatment in the case of COVID detection being tested and cleared of infection at least hours prior to traveling and securing permission from the Ministry of Public Health and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to enter into the country,Social
The AHQ and ASQ programs though welcomed continue to pale in comparison to the volumes handled prior to the pandemic when travel was free and unrestricted,Social
This can be attributed to the reluctance of most people to undergo isolation for a period of at least days the significant paperwork and costs associated with applying and undergoing these programs,Social
After several months of nonlocal transmissions the countrys first local case a merchant working at a seafood market in Samut Sakhon province was detected on December,Social
The government acted promptly to conduct widespread contact tracing masstesting and stepped up preparations and controls in response,Social
Part of these controls included restrictions on mass gatherings public activities closures of certain businesses considered as high risk and encouraging people to stay and work from home,Social
Healthcare is a fundamental need for all societies,Social
In Thailand and throughout much of the world the aging demographic is accelerating the demand for healthcare to prevent or treat illness and to improve the quality of life of patients,Social
International medical tourism is a significant and lucrative contributor to the healthcare industry,Social
It is dependent not only on the attractiveness of Thailand as a world travel and medical destination where it punches well above its weight relative to other competing countries in the costquality equilibrium but also fundamentally on free and unhindered travel to and from Thailand,Social
Demographic structural changes towards an aging society is increasing the demand for medical services relying on advanced technology,Social
It is expected that Thailand will become an aged society in with the population age years and over accounting for of the total population,Social
This means that the higher proportion of the elderly will cause the health care costs to increase substantially as it is the old who are at highest risk for illness and chronic diseases and when ill present proportionately higher acuity,Social
Diseases affecting the circulatory system diabetes cancer and chronic respiratory diseases are increasingly recorded in epidemiology,Social
The growing middle class and higher purchasing power allow for higher discretionary spending for private hospital services,Social
Urban communities are expanding with Thailands urbanization rate expected to go up from in to in according to the United Nations,Social
Combined with such government policies as various longterm infrastructure investments the establishment of special economic zones and the Eastern Bumrungrad Hospital Public Company Limited Economic Corridor EEC projects these are expected to increase the opportunities for medical service providers to expand their operations into these areas while accommodating the increasing number of foreigners who will come to work or invest in Thailand,Social
As the COVID pandemic is prolonged a new normal in how people interact work and consume has rapidly emerged and a number of technologies previously less ubiquitous particularly in Thailand has seen considerable acceleration in adoption from telemedicine to telecommuting,Social
There is a broad increase and dependence on all things digital,Social
It is expected that demand for digital remotely provided healthcare such as telemedicine telepharmacy and telemonitoring will continue to grow rapidly in the future as patients become more inclined to connecting to their healthcare provider and consumer behaviors adapt and anneal,Social
This longterm shift will drive healthcare providers towards offering seamless userfriendly convenient and integrated ecosystems centered on a digital care platform,Social
A culmination and example of this model is the Company partnering with MK,Social
Real Estate Company Limited and Minor International Public Company Limited in collaborating to offer a luxury medical wellness sanatorium in antiaging medicine and preventive health care,Social
This is in line with Bumrungrads vision of providing holistic healthcare with worldclass innovations by and in line with the Tourism Authority of Thailands policy to promote Thailand as the Medical and Wellness Resort of the World by,Social
In addition the medical industry is designated as a new target industry New SCurve with the government providing benefits such as tax cuts to attract investors in setting up a research base drug manufacturing and producing medical innovations,Social
This is expected to benefit private hospitals in lowering certain supply costs and increasing the quantity and quality of human capital thus increasing their competitiveness against businesses overseas while further strengthening the Thai healthcare business,Social
The domestic market consists mainly of Thais of uppermiddle class incomes and above,Social
The international market primarily comprises local expatriate community and medical tourism patients from countries where healthcare infrastructure and services lack quality access or affordability,Social
