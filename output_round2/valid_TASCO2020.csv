Energy Saving In we focused on efficient energy management through continuous efforts in innovative ideas and initiatives related to fuel and energy savings and GHG emission reduction,Environmental
We are focusing on the transition from diesel as fossil fuel energy to using renewable energy such as switching to biodiesel B for hot oil boilers in the asphalt production process and switching to biodiesel B for the Groups asphalt distribution trucks,Environmental
In addition both automated and manual production processes were modified and improved to increase energy efficiency,Environmental
Total energyfuel consumption in was gigajoule and the consumption of energy intensity per unit of product was gigajoule per ton produced a decline of compared to figures which did not meet our reduction taget,Environmental
Promote Circular Economy Water Use and Wastewater Discharge Our plants in Thailand are located in areas with abundant water sources while our production process requires a relatively low amount of water,Environmental
