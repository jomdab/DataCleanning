The People Function together with business functions and relevant support functions is responsible for identifying people risks based on appropriate analysis given the business complexity of each function as well as for assessing controlling monitoring and reporting risks to the Banks management with periodic reviews and updates regarding potential risks,Governance
The people risk management framework involves three major considerations,Governance
People capability and capacity SCBs business approach is based on transforming employees and equipping them with the right skills and capabilities for future banking as well as engaging them with the work and performance of the functions,Social
The Bank expands the scope of employees decisionmaking authority increases their capabilities and provides learning opportunities and a conducive working environment to enable them to reach their fullest potential,Social
People conduct SCBs business approach is based on all employees adhering to the highest levels of integrity and promoting risk ownership defining accountabilities and collaboration among business units for a positive work culture,Social
People health and safety SCBs business approach is based on a strong commitment to creating a safe working environment for people with due consideration to both physical and emotional health,Social
Failure to put any of the above considerations into practice may lead to varying degrees of people risk depending on the situation,Social
Therefore it is critical to assess control and mitigate people risks to within the Banks risk appetite,Governance
People are vital resources in the banking business,Social
Therefore the Bank needs people capacity and capability to help achieve its business goals in a sustainable manner,Social
SCB duly recognizes the importance of human resources which have been subject to significant and constant challenges in todays environment,Social
A key challenge is the advent of new technologies which may replace existing service delivery platforms and put pressure on an organization to reform or transform itself,Social
Such broadscale organizational change increases the demands on human resources in terms of both quality and quantity,Social
Specifically an organization requires knowledgeable wellrounded and adaptable people to drive change within the organization,Social
SCB has taken measures to mitigate such risks by building a risk culture whereby risk awareness and ownership are the norm and risk mitigation and prevention are the responsibilities of all staff,Governance
Moreover the Bank set up SCB Academy to build additional skills and knowledge for its people such as product knowledge and data analytics skills related to business analysis and planning,Social

Emerging Risks Climate Related Risks Affecting Credit Quality in the Banks Portfolio and loan Growth to Support Customers Business Impacts from climate change risks resulted in subsequent physical risk affecting economy whether in terms of gradual downturn interruptions of business damage to assets as well as a decline in quality and quantity of natural resources agricultural outputs and commodity,Environmental
In addition an emerging transition risk resulted from policy regulatory and technology to address climate change issue in Thailand is a transition to a lowcarbon economy and adoption of environmentalfriendly technology,Environmental
Accordingly the Thai government is in the process of drafting a Climate Change Act which will serve as key economic mechanism in driving the private sector to adopt longterm climate change implementations,Environmental
Directed by this law private and public companies are required to maintain and disclose greenhouse gas emission inventory and report reductions while integrating climate change risks as part of corporate planning or initiatives consequently impacting change in asset value in certain industry such as fossil business carbonintensive industry,Environmental
Climate change poses credit risk and financial risk to SCB through portfolio exposures to business that experiences acute and chronic natural phenomena caused by climate change,Environmental
To tackle the environmental problems regulatory changes will also be enforced to reshape the way companies conduct business at a national level,Environmental
During a transition towards lowcarbon economy carbon intensive industry will lose their competitiveness as a result of governments measures or large corporates initiative leading to limited opportunities for the Bank to provide financial product to support the clients business growth,Social
Nevertheless this also presents a business opportunity should the Bank maintain continuous dialogue with clients on environmental issues and management,Environmental

AI technologies enable the Bank to ensure more efficient operations improve products and services and deliver better customer experience,Social
Within years the Bank is heading towards becoming a Tech Bank or a tech company that offers financial services by working with more business partners to deliver the best solution for customers,Social
Accordingly accessing and utilizing significant amounts of data by AI and machine learning raises concerns for stakeholders in terms of data collection data processing data privacy and security,Social
As AI and machine learning are increasingly deployed for credit decision there is a potential for algorithms to create bias and discrimination which may cause reputation risk,Social
At SCB AI and machine learning are applied to the credit assessment process which could lead to risks in algorithm fairness as the accuracy and efficiency of the developed algorithm relies heavily on quality of input data both in terms of structure and correctness,Social
Without depth understanding and mitigation approach in place the use of imprecise or partial algorithm would result in discrimination to certain segments of customers affecting the Banks ability in supporting financial accessibility to all groups of customer specifically the vulnerable groups who are in the most need for financial support,Social
SCB acknowledges and prepares for the challenges regarding innovation and development in the digital transformation era,Social
