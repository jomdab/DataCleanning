Such recruitment is carried out for all companies within the group,Social

Every physician and nurse have been selected and approved by the Medical Committee of the respective hospital,Social

The Company also organizes continuous training programs for physicians and nurses to develop medical knowledge of related personnel,Social
This includes training for nurses so that they have expertise in providing patient care prior to starting work,Social
Furthermore the Company recognizes the importance of investments in medical technology medical tools and equipment which can indirectly attract capable and expert medical personnel to remain with the hospital for a longer time period,Social
Such technology and equipment also help to foster experiences and skills in medical diagnoses and treatments,Social

During the previous year the Department of Internal Trade Ministry of Commerce issued the notication on medicine price control which has a direct impact on the hospital business especially in the private sector,Social
The Company BDMS As for the strategy in procurement of medical equipment and tools the Company shall consider different dimensions comprising of the qualications and quality of equipment treatment benets safety delivery period cost of ownership as well as report on the comparison between tools from the worlds leading institute of medical equipment,Social
Besides the procurement of medical equipment and tools in the digital era must take into consideration the security of information and cyber stability which may affect these medical equipment and tools,Social

Risk from operation Risk from government measures According to the notication issued by the Central Committee on Prices of Goods and Servives regarding the Determination of Goods and Services under control dated January medicines medical supplies used in disease treatment medical care medical service and other services relating to disease treatment must be controlled goods and services,Social
This is to ensure the transparency of medicines and medical supplies costs treatment fees medical service fees and other relevant fees of the hospital will remain at an appropriate level and fair to all parties as well as to provide customers with more alternatives,Social
Consequently the Central Committee on Prices of Goods and Services issued a notication on May to enforce the hospitals to report the purchase and sale price of medicines that have been listed in the Universal Coverage Emergency Patients UCEP as well as other medicines specied by Thai Medicines Terminology TMT,Social
In a case where the hospital intends to sell medicines at the price different from prior notication such changes must be informed no less than days in advance,Social
Besides in a case where medicines are sold to the outpatients the hospital must issue the prescription based on the standard of medical profession and the quotation for prior acknowledgement of the patient,Social
Risk from economic volatility The National Economic and Social Development Council February estimates that the Thai economy GDP is likely to grow by only in according to the restrictions from the outbreak of the Covid drought and delay of budget,Social
Even though health care is one of the four requisites of life economic impact can affect the consumers purchasing power and customers of some private hospitals may choose to delay or lessen their visit to the hospitals for example delay of treatment postponement of visit for elective procedures shortening their hospital stays and reducing their medical expenditures by visiting public hospitals or other less expensive private hospitals,Social
The Company has also set up the strategy to expand its network to various provinces that have potential and are in need of the private hospitals to encompass every region,Social
There is also a consideration of setting up patient protection fund to compensate for damages to the patients whereby health care clinics including the Company as one of the health care business operators are responsible for contributing money to such fund in accordance with the rules procedures and rate determined by the Patient Protection Committee,Social
The Company and network hospitals operate in compliance with various quality standards such as Joint Commission International JCI and Hospital Accreditation HA to operate and comply with HA system requires that a committee must be established to monitor the quality of patient care and ensure that it meets the standard of safety and environmental conservation as well as monitor various risks especially risk in providing medical care,Social
These actions may lessen potential impact arising from legal changes concerning health and environment,Social
It was forecasted that there will be an opening of private hospitals in Bangkok and suburban area resulting in approximately more beds compared to the current situation where more than private hospitals nationwide report a total of beds or more,Social
Besides the Company has closely monitored different situations and acknowledged that the requirement for domestic treatment has consistently grown,Social
Therefore the Company has put in place a team of expert doctors and nurses who are ready to provide medical services of every area,Social
The Company also established centers of excellence where medical services have been improved according to the international standard of Joint Commission International JCI,Social
The Company has well received a cooperation from leading medical institutions and has successfully set up network hospitals in every region with the purpose to facilitate the customers and provide them with more alternatives while being able to transfer them to other network hospitals in case of potentially complicated treatment procedures,Social
At present the hospital business in Thailand is faced with the lack of medical personnel,Social
A major reliance is placed upon the public sector to develop medical personnel and there have not been sufcient medical personnel to meet such demand,Social
A n n u a l R e p o r t information to patients manage patients expectations evaluate customers satisfaction as well as improve reporting procedures and problem solving when they le complaints constantly promote the standard of service according to international practice to ensure that the treatment provided is of good quality and safe while preventing any legal disputes,Social
This customer group chooses to come to Thailand for health care services because of our internationally recognized standards and quality of medical services reasonable medical fees and Thailands renowned tourism industry,Social
Therefore the Company is facing risks from different crises that may affect the patients condence in visiting Thailand for health care services which is beyond the Companys control such as domestic politics as well as natural disasters and increased competition,Social
All of these factors will directly impact the number of foreign patients who will travel to Thailand for medical service purpose,Social
Thus the Company has specied the policy to diversify and lessen this risk by expanding the hospital network to other provinces across the country which have potential and require medical services,Social
However BDMS is a large hospital network and has consistently provided educational and research funding to medical personnel,Social
The Company established BDMS Simulation Center to improve skills and expertise in clinical operation specialized skills as well as medical knowledge in various elds in order to become Knowledge Organization,Social
In addition the Company constantly seeks stateoftheart technology and medical equipment to facilitate medical examination and diagnosis to enhance treatment and surgery accuracy,Social
The Company also set up measures to give a fair compensation compared to other operators in private hospital business,Social
Furthermore the Company has taken good care of every staff starting from maintaining their good health providing treatment when being sick promoting healthy body and mind and most importantly becoming the network hospital which encompasses almost every area of the country so that the Companys personnel can return to their previous hometown and being able to work and take care of their family at the same time,Social
Another important strategy is to encourage medical personnel under BDMS network to assist the government agency within their own community whether they will be a teacher lecturer project consultant and a learning center that provides treatment and service of international standard all of which will promote good relationship between public and private hospitals as well as a coordination in program development to ensure that the personnel are able to respond to the Companys requirements,Social
Legal risk At present people are more aware of news and their rights especially with the issuance of the Act on Court Proceedings for Consumer Cases BE that enables the consumers and patients to le suit against health care service providers more easily,Social
This law may affect these health care service providers and medical personnel that in turn will put the Company at risk of being sued for medical services it provides,Social
The Company has set up the Debtor Management Committee comprising of the management from nance and operations and has organized the meeting on a regular basis,Governance
Therefore the economic status of the country of origin of foreign patients incurs an impact on the number of local patients,Social
