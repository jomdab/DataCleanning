And nally it showed the world just how important the maritime industry is in our consumerdriven world,Social
Supply Chain Disruptions The maritime industry is one of the most efcient links in the supply chain system so when it gets disrupted it creates inefciencies that result in an immediate increase in tonmile demand,Social
Covid has disrupted supply chain systems as well as all aspects of life and business,Social
Port congestion is seeing no letup as Chinas covidzero policy combined with omicron the most transmissible variant is creating more not less congestion in Chinese ports,Environmental
Global ports are caught up in the ripple effects owing from Chinese ports,Social

Climate change is here not in another decade or two or four but right now,Environmental
Bloomberg states that of the hottest years since have occurred since the start of and the ocean subsurface in broke the annual heat record set in,Environmental
This will make storms hurricanes tornadoes and ocean waves ever more powerful,Social
Climate change will lead to weather related disruptions with heightened congestion at ports slower speeds at sea due to strongerbigger waves and loss of containers from ships a regular occurrence,Environmental
Oceans absorb almost a rd of all CO emitted by mankind,Environmental
This has made oceans extremely acidic will result in the death of coral reefs and a corresponding reduction in the sh population,Social
GHG emissions will continue to rise as the climate change impact will result in greater demand for electricity with fossil fuel burning CO belching power plants increasing the amount of CO that we put into the atmosphere,Environmental
This will start a vicious cycle with greater power demand from factories warehouses transportdelivery organizations to cool homes workplaces theatres stadiums etcetera demanding more power from fossil fuel burning power plants releasing even more CO into the atmosphere creating ever more climate change heat res droughts oods stormsand the cycle goes onandon,Environmental
Food production will be hit hard by climate change and we may nd ourselves facing food insecurity no matter how wealthy the nation we live in,Environmental
This will focus governments on building up buffer stocks of food grains to avoid sharp price increases in food staples with the resultant ination that it would bring,Social
The World Inequality Lab published the World Inequality Report in December,Social
Three things stand out in this report,Social
First from to the top wealthiest people took of the growth in global wealth while the bottom got just,Social
Second in the wealth inequality between nations was just while the maximum inequality was within the people of each country,Social
By due to colonization and the industrial revolution the Developed world had the highest ever concentration of global wealth at,Social
Global wealth distribution between countries narrowed by following the economic ascent of China and India but wealth inequality within each country climbed to as Developing countries allowed their wealth to be monopolized by their rich even as the wealth gap between Developed and Developing world narrowed,Social
And nally in the period to of CO emissions was between North America and Europe,Environmental
A recent IMF study stated the richest countries represent of the world population but about of CO emissions,Environmental
The poorest countries about of the worlds population account for less than of emissions Ergo increasing wealth disparity and increased CO emissions go hand in hand,Environmental
Regulatory Developments The Economist came out with a beautiful lm entitled How chemical pollution is suffocating the seas and is a must watch minutes that will change the way you view the businessasusual world that we live in,Environmental
Decarbonization is the new buzz word and made its rst appearance in TradeWinds in December,Environmental
It appeared in Precious Shipping Public Company Limited Annual Report just articles from then until April,Social
And has since appeared in TradeWinds more than times,Social
So before you get lost in the details let me remind you that Shipping carries around of all cargoes in the world and is responsible for less than of greenhousegas GHG emissions,Environmental
The Economist stated in their issue dated th September that according to the UNs Food and Agriculture Organization raising animals for meat eggs and milk accounts for of global GHG emissions And the Economist of th October asks a very valid question if beef emits times more CO per calorie of food than tofu does and coal emits times more CO per unit of energy output than hydropower then why are we phasing out coal but not beef The EU has included shipping in its Emissions,Environmental
Trading Scheme ETS while giving a free pass to the livestock industry and has proposed exempting Private Jets from their planned jet fuel tax even though private jets are the most polluting of all aircraft on a passengermile basis,Environmental
And here we are grappling with Zero Emission Vessels ZEVs while no one is talking about curtailing the emissions from the livestock business or penalizing private jets,Environmental
Personally I have become a vegetarian since the start of and that represents my effort to save the planet from global warming by not supporting the livestock industry,Environmental
Our ofce executive lunch served every weekday has become fully vegetarian since the start of representing our collective effort at reducing GHG emissions during our midday meal,Environmental
The IMO adopted the Energy Efciency Existing Ship Index EEXI as amendments to Marpol Annex VI that will enter into force on st January,Environmental
EEXI describes the CO emissions per cargo tonmile by determining the standardized CO emissions related to installed engine power transport capacity and ship speed,Environmental
Statistics suggest a bulker k to k built preEEDI Energy Efciency Design Index ie ships built pre may require a to power reduction K K speed reduction from todays speeds but ships built postEEDI may require just power reduction K speed reduction to comply with EEXI,Environmental
Implementation of engine power limitation and energysaving device technologies will be used by owners to choose the solution best suited for their ships and will be very positive for increasing rates in the dry bulk markets,Environmental
We will be getting all our ships rated for EEXI and Carbon Intensity Indicator so that we will be in full compliance prior to the new laws coming into force,Environmental
The IMO has agreed to debate and arrive at a solution on marketbased mechanisms MBMs to reduce the CO footprint from shipping,Environmental
This could be via a carbon levy on each tonne of fuel,Environmental
The Solomon Islands and Marshall Islands have suggested a pertonne levy of CO released which is a pertonne levy on fuel oil,Environmental
The idea of any MBMs is to make current bunker fuel as expensive as say ammonia,Environmental
So the price of fuel oil must reach per tonne the current price is about per tonne to match the cost of future fuels for zeroemission vessels,Environmental
It is hoped that pressure from the EUs ETS will help prod and push the IMO into taking a strong stand on MBMs via a carbonbased levy,Environmental
The funds collected from any IMO MBMs via a fuelbased levy could be used in many ways to make a level playing eld for greener fuels from subsidies to research and development,Environmental
These include To subsidize the difference between a ton of fuel oil and two tons of ammonia that is when their energy output equivalence is reached for the rst movers in ZEVs,Environmental
To make the cost of fuel for transporting goods on IC engine ships identical to ZEVs for the enduser,Environmental
To fund research and development to produce ZEVs their designs their regulations and their infrastructure,Social
To develop green welltowake ZEV fuels and their landbased support infrastructure,Environmental
To allow the IMO to mandate recycling of IC engine ships that are older than years of age from or some earlier agreed date,Environmental
To make it a level playing eld for charterers to select ships purely based on GHG emissions and no other economic factor,Environmental
That is a small price to pay for preventing climate catastrophe,Environmental
Covid Covid has become synonymous with delays supply chain disruptions lockdowns higher ination due to the massive governmentled stimuli creating demand that far outstrips supply,Social
Economic recovery from the pandemic has been very uneven for reasons,Social
Countries were hit by Covid and went into lockdowns hurting their economies at different times uneven rates of vaccinations in rich and poor countries and high levels of stimuli in rich countries and lack of it in poor countries has made the recovery patchy,Social
In we will get to grips with the labor market the impact of workfromhome fear of working in ofce with infected people prioritizing a better worklife balance and demand for better wages and working conditions,Social
For the Maritime Industry the impact of Omicron will be to make crew change even more difcult and that is a challenge that we will have to face headon in,Social
Omicron has been designated a virus of concern due to the large number of mutations to its spike protein which makes it times more transmissible than the Delta variant according to various news articles,Environmental
The good news on this variant is that though caseloads are spiking hospitalizations and death rates have not yet risen and the bad news is that it is so infectious that the sheer number of cases can overload the health care system of any country,Social
In response several countries have halved isolation periods and so far it appears that this decision has been justied,Social
If the UK Prime Minister Harold Macmillan was alive and was asked today what the greatest challenge was for a statesman he would have probably replied Jabs in arms dear boy jabs in arms The problem is that we have too many craven politicians but not a single statesman who can make such a simple mantra of jabs in arms a worldwide reality,Social
The bad news was American Omicron cases crashing through million cases on th January Europe reporting that at current infection rates more than of their population could be infected by Omicron within weeks,Social
All this could portend that we are at the beginningoftheend of the pandemic perhaps,Social
Omicron and other yet to be discovered variants will make only work from ofce impractical,Social
Only working from home will suffer from the lack of networking human contact and sparks created when working together with creativity being compromised,Social
As a result the future of work will be some sort of a hybrid between only working from home or only from ofce,Social
Each business and industry will develop norms that work best for them while keeping diversity and equality in mind and business leaders will be guided by such industry wide best practices,Social
For those who have lost loved ones or those that have lost their livelihoods due to Covid has been a devastating year with higher prices and ination eating into their meagre savings,Social
Climate change has ripped apart communities and created a new wave of climaterefugees,Environmental

During the year MDWT was recycled and MDWT was delivered thus making net eet growth of,Environmental
This will help reduce the pressure from the Supply side of the equation,Environmental
While the supply side looks appealing on the surface it does not factor in upcoming regulatory impacts or the current age prole of the eet,Environmental
Secondly vessels over the age of were designed built and delivered at a time when the average price of oil was barrel with a low of barrel during the peak of the Asian Crisis during hence were designed for power and not for fuel economy,Environmental
Ships that are years old or older will nd it difcult to compete against younger more fuel efcient vessels,Environmental
Ships years or older comprising MDWT or of the existing eet MDWT of geared ships or and MDWT of the gearless eet or at the start of would be ideal candidates for recycling as they would have to invest in ballast water treatment systems IMO expensive special surveys and face regulatoryled recycling in due to EEXI and CII,Environmental
In this sector ships of MDWT or will be over years of age by end of and some or all of them are likely to be recycled during to,Environmental
In this sector ships of MDWT or will be over years of age by end of and some or all of them are likely to be recycled during to,Environmental
In this sector ships of MDWT or will be over years of age by end of and some or all of them are likely to be recycled during to,Environmental
In this sector ships of MDWT or will be over years of age by end of and some or all of them are likely to be recycled during to,Environmental
When reading the above numbers please keep in mind that Slippage was and recycling accounted for MDWT in,Environmental
Slippage has averaged over the last years to and recycling accounted for MDWT annually over the last years to,Environmental
Both slippage and recycling uctuate inversely with the BDI and availability of nance,Environmental
Recycling of ships The freight market is the prime mover that drives ships to the recycling yards,Environmental
The lower the freight market the greater the number of ships ending up at the recycling yards,Environmental
Regulatory impacts should see many more ships heading for the recycling yard in and beyond,Environmental
IMO has resulted in more expensive but cleaner LSFO being burnt by ships from st January,Environmental
As a result the level of pollutants reaching the air that we breathe as well as the acid rain that results from such emissions has been reduced,Environmental
International Maritime Organization IMO conventions International Maritime Organization IMO conventions are constantly updated to match demands for enhanced steps to protect the environment,Environmental
The regulation mandated that sulphur levels in fuel oils consumed by ships outside emission control areas not to exceed by mass referred to as Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil or VLSFO,Environmental
There remain some concerns regarding the quality of VLSFO being supplied at several ports and suitability for use on ships equipment that were designed primarily for use with fuels with higher sulphur levels which contributed towards lubricity as well as optimum viscosity,Environmental
The alternative to VLSFO was installing Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems also referred to as exhaust gas scrubbers or simply scrubbers in which case vessels could continue using high sulphur fuel oils HSFO Sulphur content of up to and the scrubbers would then be expected to wash down and scrub the exhaust gases to reduce the sulphur content to below levels,Environmental
The inherent drawback with such a system was that the wash water which would have to be discharged at sea would contain all the additional sulphur in the form of sulphuric and sulphurous acids thereby polluting the seas instead,Environmental
Several countries the world over have already banned discharging of wash water in their territorial waters thereby requiring owners going with the scrubber option to carry on board adequate reserves of VLSFO in addition to HSFO,Environmental
Ships need to take ballast basically sea water in dedicated ballast tanks on board so that the ship remains stable when there is no cargo on board and so that the ships propeller is kept well submerged in the water,Environmental
Administrations of most countries in the world insist on stringent ballast water management practices on board ships so that potentially invasive aquatic life forms from one part of the world do not get deposited in their waters thereby affecting the local ecosystem,Environmental
Hence the need for regulations that require ships to treat the ballast water taken in the ballast tanks by means of approved Ballast Water Treatment Systems BWTS which need to be installed on board,Environmental
The IMO Ballast Water Management Convention entered into force on th September months after ratication by States representing of world merchant shipping tonnage,Environmental
All vessels are required to carry a Ballast Water Management certicate,Environmental
New vessels built date of keel laying after the above date are required to be tted with IMO approved ballast treatment plants and existing vessels are required to retrot such plants in a phased manner along with surveys associated with rst renewal of IOPP International Oil Pollution Prevention certicate after th September,Environmental
There are a few IMO approved treatment plants presently in the market have not yet met the more stringent USCG approval requirements,Social
USCG as well as IMO approved BWTS have already been tted on vessels in PSLs eet,Social
Of the remaining vessels which currently are required to exchange the ballast water taken at ports with ballast taken at over nautical miles from any coast so that they may be permitted to discharge the ballast water at the next port vessels will be tted with such approved BWTS in and one in early,Environmental
As a result of initiatives from the International Labor Organization ILO working and living conditions of crewmembers on board are receiving increased importance,Social
To formalize this and ensure uniform compliance ILO has adopted the Maritime Labour Convention MLC,Social
A Maritime Labour Certicate MLC and a Declaration of Maritime Labour Compliance DMLC is required on board to ensure compliance with the Convention for all ships above tons in international trade,Social
These certicates are to be obtained from the Flag state and their recognized organizations after verication and surveys on board each vessel,Social
The MLC has attained the required number of member state ratications in August,Social
The Statement of Compliance SOC with MLC which was being issued till date on our Thai agged vessels has now been replaced with a Marine Labour Certicate,Social
This is a welcome development and facilitates smooth trading of Thai agged vessels worldwide as it eliminates the risk of the SOC not being acceptable in some countries,Social
Singapore had ratied MLC earlier,Social
Hence the Companys vessels that are registered in Singapore have already been compliant all along,Social
Ships that are subject to MLC are now required to display certicates issued by an insurer or other nancial security provider conrming that insurance or other nancial security is in place for the cost and expense of crew repatriation as well as up to four months contractually entitled arrears of wages and entitlements in case a vessel is abandoned Regulation,Social
It is no longer just fashionable to say we are Going Green organizations worldover are being pushed by their stakeholders to become more environmentconscious guided by compliance with the newer regulations,Environmental
IMO along with the ICS have put in place regulations which will apply to shipping globally,Social
One of these is the mandatory reporting of CO emissions measured in grammestonnemile on voyages like the European Union MRV rules Monitoring Reporting Verication of CO emissions which has been implemented from January for all vessels operating in the EU region,Environmental
IMO also requires all vessels to implement a fuel consumption data collection system DCS from January,Environmental
This requires vessels to report annual fuel oil consumption worldwide to IMO through the ag administration,Environmental
In April the IMO adopted a resolution on the strategy of a reduction of total GHG emissions by as compared to the levels of the year,Environmental
These regulations will in turn phase out older less efcient vessels,Social
We have taken the initiative to prepare in advance for these regulations by monitoring and collecting CO emissions data on all vessels in the eet,Environmental
The company has arranged for all vessels to report such fuel consumption data to a RO approved by the ag from st January onwards,Environmental
The vessels are always operated with clean hulls by using efcient anti fouling paints and by hull cleaning when necessary as this increases efciency thereby reducing carbon emission,Environmental
Eco operation will be possible with larger cargo hauls on vessels with very fuelefcient engines and through optimized use of waste heat from the engines even the exhaust gases from the auxiliary engines are diverted through the boiler to use the available heat,Environmental
These new Ultramax vessels with larger cargo carrying capacity operate with substantially lower CO emissions,Environmental
The Getting to Zero Coalition The Getting to Zero Coalition is a partnership between the Global Maritime Forum the Friends of Ocean Action and the World Economic Forum,Social
It builds on the Call to Action in Support of Decarbonization launched in October and signed by more than leaders from across the maritime industry nancial institutions and other stakeholders as well as on the Poseidon Principles a global framework for climatealigned ship nancing launched on th June,Environmental
PSL is a member of the Getting to Zero Coalition and will help design the GHG reduced future of the maritime transportation industry,Environmental
A key starting point to reach this goal is to have commercially viable zeroemission vessels ZEVs operating along deepsea trade routes by,Social
This will require both developing vessels as well as the future fuel supply chain which can only be done through close collaboration and deliberate collective action between the maritime industry the energy sector the nancial sector Governments and IGOs,Social
Research presented at the working session shows that the short termambition adopted by members states of the IMO in April of reducing international shippings emissions per transport work by at least by will not be enough to prevent shippings adverse impact on the climate,Environmental
This revealed the need to develop policies demand drivers and funding mechanisms to motivate and derisk rstmover investments adopt policy instruments and marketbased measures to close the competitiveness gap between conventional and zeroemission fuels and associated infrastructure explore and narrow down technologies fuel options and transition pathways identify and grasp global opportunities for green energy projects that can propel maritime shippings decarbonization and contribute to,Environmental
sustainable and inclusive growth in developing economies while making sure no countries are left behind,Social
Coalition members are now Precious Shipping Public Company Limited Annual Report prepared to move ahead of regulators to develop the technologies and business models needed to meet decarbonization targets,Social
The maritime industrys rst movers stand steadfast to take the steps needed to develop test and scale the technologies required to decarbonize international shipping,Social
The sector focuses on how to eliminate emissions and is leaning its efforts into the advance of fuel and technology offerings that avoid emissions altogether,Environmental
New marine fuels derived from abundant untapped renewable resources could bring substantial development gains but will require signicant changes to ships ports and operations,Environmental
Global Warming and Green House Gases GHG Shipping may be the cleanest environmentally friendly and most fuelefcient mode of transportation but a major source of carbon dioxide and GHGs,Environmental
When it comes to decarbonization the maritime sector must play an even larger role in addressing climate change as the sector is a key stakeholder when it comes to both the causes and solutions related to the issue,Environmental
Awareness of the detrimental effects of Global Warming GHGs and Sulphur dioxide pollution has become widespread and focus on the environment has come under the spotlight,Environmental
Organizations worldover have become more conscious about the environment than ever before and shipping is no exception,Environmental
As per the Fourth IMO GHG study that was published in early as of total CO emitted by international shipping was to the tune of of the global CO emissions,Environmental
Besides CO ships also release a handful of other global warming pollutants like Black Carbon BC and Nitrous Oxide NO which exacerbate global climate change and ocean acidication,Environmental
These pollutants contribute to global climate change either directly by acting as agents that trap heat in the atmosphere or indirectly by aiding in the creation of additional greenhouse gases,Environmental
To put that in perspective though livestock on the other hand is responsible for of GHG according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency,Environmental
On a positive note through the years to the carbon intensity of international shipping improved roughly by and the total GHG emissions from shipping dropped by despite a growth in maritime trade,Environmental
However during the years to the total GHG emissions from maritime shipping rose from MMT to MMT while short lived climate pollutants like black carbon and methane emissions rose by and respectively,Environmental
The year had seen an unprecedented decline in global emissions by which was a result of temporary behavioral changes in response to the massive economic disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic and measures taken to contain it,Environmental
Carbon intensity in shipping also improved by in the year relative to,Environmental
To formalize PSLs commitment towards preserving and conserving the environment and reducing our carbon footprint we are ISO certied,Environmental
The IMO has used as a Baseline to plan and develop a roadmap for the comprehensive strategy on reducing GHGs from ships,Environmental
Likewise PSL has used as its baseline to monitor the average decline of CO emissions over its entire eet,Environmental
A clear understanding of established goals and targets over the years has led to a steady decline in the overall CO emissions and an improvement of the ships operational carbon intensity,Environmental
Since the Company has been maintaining and evaluating emission records for the entire eet a credible baseline to evaluate progress,Environmental
Over the years the older vessels were phased out and additional fuel efcient ECO vessels were acquired,Environmental
In the year the average carbon intensity per transport work was estimated at Grams CO per Tonne Nautical Mile,Environmental
IMOs latest regulations on Green House Gas Emissions and the introduction of EEXI and CII the gamechanger In line with IMOs initial strategy of achieving a reduction in the intensity of CO emissions of up to per transport work by and up to by to reduce GHG emissions from ships in June the IMO introduced two measures a The Energy Efciency Design Index for Existing ships EEXI and b Carbon Intensity Indicator CII and corresponding regulations that will affect of the,Environmental
Introduction of these new regulations will have a very major effect on the shipping industry as a whole and will challenge ship owners like never before,Social
Below we explain briey what these two terms EEXI and CII mean and how the regulations have impacted the shipping industry,Social
EEXI Expressed in Grams of CO emitted per tonnemile of transport work EEXI is dependent solely on the design parameters of the main and auxiliary engines such as designed power cargo carrying capacity and speed,Environmental
One such corrective measure would be to install Energy Saving Devices eg Mewis Duct,Environmental
The reduction in the attained EEXI by installing ESDs however is very marginal,Environmental
of Vessels CO emitted MT Averrage Cll grams tonnemile No,Environmental
of Vessels CO emitted MT Averrage Cll grams tonnemile No,Environmental
of Vessels CO emitted MT Averrage Cll grams tonnemile for some of the newer vessels built after will need to limit the maximum power developed by the main engine,Environmental
Older vessels will typically need to limit the maximum power of the main engine between as much as and,Environmental
This basically implies that the of the global eet will need to reduce the speeds at which they usually operate up to as much as if not more,Environmental
CII is also expressed in Grams of CO emitted per tonnemile,Environmental
After the survey in these vessels will operate at speeds which would be lower than the speeds that are currently described in our commercial contracts by around to knots,Social
The IMO has now standardized the method for calculating the Carbon Intensity Index CII for ships,Environmental
As can be noted from the table the average CII for PSLs eet of vessels in the year was grams of CO emitted per tonnemile,Environmental
New technologyconcepts There are already conceptual designs on small crafts that try to eliminate or minimize the human effort onboard ships,Social
Some experts in automation visualize that in the next twenty years or so ships may be totally unmanned with automated equipment using sensors smart digital systems and other technologies which can be monitored and controlled from shorebased stations completely removing the element of Human Error on board,Social
Although the concept of such autonomous vessels appeared unrealistic initially bold steps were made in this direction in both in the industry and by regulators,Social
In May Yara and Kongsberg introduced the concept of the autonomous zero emission TEU container vessel Yara Birkeland,Environmental
She completed her maiden voyage from Oslo to Porsgrunn in Norway around nautical miles in mid November,Social
The vessels engines are powered by high energy Lithium ion Leclanche batteries which are recharged by green hydroelectric power,Environmental
In October of RollsRoyce partnered with Google and introduced Augmented Reality software as part of their remote operation solutions for autonomous vessels,Social
Simultaneously with these developments in autonomous shipping IMOs Maritime Precious Shipping Public Company Limited Annual Report Safety Committee agreed to map out a new international legal framework for the safe operation of autonomous ships as operating a completely unmanned vessel brings a host of legal issues into focus,Social
Stakeholders in shipping need to keep abreast of these developments to ensure the most benecial application of the technology,Social
Stakeholders would do well to keep in mind that while there is little doubt that most accidents occur primarily because of human error the number of such accidents that are prevented solely because of human intervention cannot be downplayed,Social
Crew changes which were invariably carried out in Asia during the precovid days are now not possible with most of the countries in the Far east as well as Southeast Asia not permitting crew travel both in and out of their countries,Social
In addition we have had to incur costs for accommodating crew members at designated quarantine centres on their arrival back to their home countries,Social
Other regulations and conventions There are specic IMO Conventions and regulations mandated by individual countries to control the emission of Nitrogen oxides Halons and CFCs from ships,Environmental
Certain states in the USA are likely to require ships calling their ports to use shore power which is greener than the power generated on board ships,Environmental
Bonnet technology is another concept presently available only in certain ports which can receive the exhaust gas from ships for treatment before discharging into the atmosphere,Environmental
To formalize the Companys commitment towards preserving and conserving environment and to reduce carbon footprint the Company completed the transition audit for ISO on August and received the new ISO certication from Class NK of Japan,Environmental
The ISO provides a framework for a holistic and strategic approach to the Companys environmental policy plans and actions and will demonstrate that the Company is an environmentally responsible organization,Environmental
Vessels have also fully implemented the more stringent garbage disposal regulations required by MARPOL Annex V which came into force from January,Environmental
With effect from st December EU Regulation on Ship Recycling have been applicable to foreign ships in EU waters,Environmental
Ships comply by having an Inventory of Hazardous Materials IHM certicate issued by a Recognized Organization,Environmental
The certicate basically lists both the quantity as well as all the locations on board vessels where materials considered to be potentially harmful to humans and the environment are present,Environmental
Although both time consuming as well as expensive the company prepared for compliance with the regulation well in advance,Governance
The companys senior technical superintendents were trained by Classication Societies to acquire the necessary competencies to complete the procedures to obtain IHM compliance for all vessels,Social
The Safety of Life at Sea SOLAS convention may have amendments in the future,Social
This is driven by one of the worst maritime disasters in US history the loss of the USagged roro vessel El Faro and its crew which sank in the Bahamas in October while trying to navigate through Hurricane Joaquin,Social
The detailed USCG investigation report published in September highlighted several errors mainly by the Master and includes recommendations on safety and seeks several amendments in the SOLAS convention,Social
With the melting of the polar ice cap due to global warming and the consequent increase in navigability through the northern route on st January the IMO has adopted the Polar Code and related amendments in to make it mandatory under both SOLAS and the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships MARPOL,Environmental
The codes focus is on the safety of ships seafarers and passengers who are on board in the harsh polar environment and the regulations to prevent discharge of Oil Noxious liquid substances in bulk Sewage and Garbage,Environmental
IMOs subcommittee on Pollution prevention and response agreed in principle in to draft amendments requiring vessels navigating through Arctic waters to not carry any grade of Heavy Fuel oil,Environmental
Technologies currently available for improving Energy Efciency The shipping industry is concerned with reducing fuel consumption and carbon emissions,Environmental
Technological advancement and design modication are being used extensively to address these concerns,Social
At PSL the management understood its business implications evaluated the efciency of potential designs and took a leap forward,Social
As part of the strategy it was decided to retrot some of the vessels with Hydrodynamic Energy Saving Devices ESDs such as THE MEWIS DUCT a n system which provides a preswirl to the ship wake which reduces losses in the propeller stream PRESHROUDED VANES a device which reduces the rotational energy loss of the propeller slipstream by generating preswirl ow for energy saving and HUB VORTEX ABSORBED FINS a set of ns tted on the cap of a propeller to reduce energy losses by propeller hub,Environmental
Analysis indicates energy savings in the range of to,Environmental
Older vessels which were considered lessfuel efficient were replaced with Eco vessels between the years and,Environmental
The Eco vessels have offered more economical machinery very efcient electronically controlled engines lower lightship better hullform and optimized use of waste heat from the engines,Environmental
PSL is committed to further reducing its carbon footprint and is monitoring the progress being made on the following fronts,Environmental
Air lubrication systems uses Bubble technology to decrease the resistance between the ships hull and the water by supplying air to the ships underside creating a carpet of microbubbles that coat the entire at bottom of the vessel,Environmental
With the optimum ship hull design the air lubrication system is expected to achieve between a to reduction of CO emissions along with signicant fuel savings,Environmental
Air lubrication is an EEDIapproved technology and for some sectors of the merchant eet struggling to achieve the requisite efciency score it could offer a potential solution,Environmental
Nanotechnology fuel treatment uses a multifunctional fuel additive that contains a molecular catalyst that ensures maximum fuel efciency,Environmental
The additive can also reduce engine wear meaning the time between maintenance can be extended particles work on existing carbon buildup within the engine to effectively blast away residue,Environmental
NanOx from Martek Marine is one of the most exciting nanotechnology fuel treatments to hit the market,Environmental
Nanoclusters improve viscosity by more than for an improved fuelair mix boosting engine power by more than,Environmental
Enhanced fuel atomization in the tank injectors offers over fuel savings and microexplosions in the cylinders enable more complete combustion lowering emissions by and enabling savings on CO too,Environmental
Nanocatalysts remove carbon deposits and prevent future buildup diminishing engine wear to reduce maintenance and spares costs,Environmental
New Bulbous bow designs reduce wavemaking resistance by producing its own wave system that is out of phase with the bow wave from the hull creating a reduction in resistance made by the waves,Environmental
Volume vertical extension of the center of volume longitudinal extension and shape are all elements considered in the design,Social
The characteristics of the bow must be carefully balanced with the shape of the entrance and the transition towards the forward shoulder and bilge,Environmental
Bulbs are most effective at a specic speedlength ratio and draft,Environmental
Changes in speed and draft signicantly change the wave created meaning that reductions in draft or speed can lead to increases in resistance and this being the case compromises in the bulb design are often needed to provide good performance over the expected range of operating drafts and speeds,Environmental
Onboard DC Grid A power distribution system introduced by ABB helps vessels reduce their fuel consumption cut noise and trim their environmental impact by matching the power that the engine needs,Environmental
By ensuring the engine runs at varying speeds for ultimate fuel efciency at each load level fuel consumption can be dramatically reduced,Environmental
Recent tests using DC Grid power distribution on a platform supply vessel showed reduced fuel consumption of up to in addition to engine room noise reduction leading to improved working conditions aboard the vessel,Environmental
Low Loss Hybrid Energy System LLH by Wartsila is an innovative technology that utilizes different power sources in combination with energy storage devices to operate the prime movers closest to their optimum performance,Environmental
A key feature of the system is its ability to reduce transient engine loads that cause increased fuel consumption and added emissions,Environmental
By increasing the power redundancy the system allows the engine to operate closer to its optimum design point where it has the highest efciency and least emissions,Environmental
Reduced maintenance and increased system performance through rapid response from the energy storage system are also among the benets offered,Environmental
The overall hybrid control system is the key element in the total control and stability of the ships electrical system and the energy ows,Environmental
In addition to annual fuel savings of up to depending on the type and conguration of the engine and mission prole the LLH ensures a substantial reduction in exhaust gas emissions,Environmental
Fuel Oil Emulsion FOE technology FOE allows blended fuels to burn more completely than unmodied fuels and so uses less fuel lowers emissions and the engines run cooler and so would require less maintenance,Environmental
This would reduce the use of fuel and the level of emissions giving a signicant nancial saving,Environmental
Solar and wind power technologies are being experimented with and are showing some promise,Environmental
PSL is committed to further reducing its carbon footprint by continuing to upgrade systems on existing vessels analyze its operating proles by considering shorter ballast passages larger cargo hauls and slow steaming,Environmental
Additionally we are currently exploring the possibility of installing solar panels on our vessels to supplement the electrical power generated by Precious Shipping Public Company Limited Annual Report the ships auxiliary engines,Environmental
If this proves to be viable it will result in a reduction in CO emissions per vessel of around to tons per day,Environmental
We also intend to replace all the conventional light bulbs on board our vessels with LED lamps to reduce power consumption and thereby the quantity of CO emitted,Environmental
Future Fuels Biofuels could play a valuable role in reducing CO emissions from the marine sector over the next few years,Environmental
From a technological perspective they are the easiest to adopt as they can be blended with existing marine fuels and utilized by existing vessels,Environmental
Biofuels would also not require signicant delivery infrastructure investment,Environmental
However Biofuels are likely to be the preferred fuel for the aviation and road sectors given the high energy density relative to alternative clean fuels and therefore there simply may not be adequate volumes available to the marine sector over the longterm,Environmental
That said Biofuel blends are likely to gain traction in the coming years as this is the easiest shortterm solution to reducing carbon emissions in the marine sector,Environmental
Hydrogen as a fuel is attractive because it emits no carbon or other pollutants when used,Environmental
Existing hydrogen manufactures can produce blue or lowcarbon hydrogen by capturing and storing the carbon emitted during the production process,Environmental
However research is underway to develop energyefcient processes for producing green hydrogen from water via thermochemical processes using renewable energy,Environmental
Another potential approach to produce carbonneutral fuels involves chemically processing green hydrogen together with carbon or nitrogen to produce gaseous or liquid fuel,Environmental
The energy density of hydrogen gas is relatively low and it would need to be liqueed and stored under pressure to be viable as fuel creating a transportation and storage challenge,Environmental
A unit of cooled liquid hydrogen has less than half the energy of diesel and requires more than double the space to store it,Environmental
Furthermore signicant infrastructure investments will be necessary to store and transport the cryogenic liquid which has a C boiling point,Environmental
Given these limitations Hydrogen is unlikely to gain the kind of traction that we have seen with Ammonia,Environmental
Ammonia While it could be several years before it is adopted at scale Ammonia does enjoy the privilege of having the largest share of zeroemission vessel prototype projects worldwide,Environmental
Its molecular makeup NH allows for a carbon and sulphurfree combustion,Environmental
Today most commercially available Ammonia is derived from fossil fuels which makes its green credentials less than pristine,Environmental
That will change once Ammonia is produced at scale through a renewable energy powered electrolysis process a development that is expected to take place in the latter half of this decade,Environmental
Early adopters of Ammonia as a fuel are likely to be Niche vessels operating in regions with strict emission controls and on xed routes Ammonia Tankers and LPG Tankers capable of transporting Ammonia,Environmental
This will likely be followed by energy guzzlers such as large Cruise and Container carriers on routes where Ammonia as fuel is easily available,Environmental
Bulk carriers which consume about of total marine fuel consumed globally will unlikely be early adopters because of their varied trade routes,Environmental
The key to the adoption of Ammoniapowered vessels would be the establishment of safety and training standards which could take several years given the more complex nature of the fuel,Social
Methanol is a safe costeffective and globally available marine fuel with global production of MMT,Environmental
However it could be renewable as it can be produced from a variety of renewable feedstocks or as an electrofuel,Environmental
Methanol fuel produces no sulphur emissions very low levels of nitrogen oxide emissions and is biodegradable,Environmental
It can also be blended into existing fossil fuels,Environmental
Current dual fuel Methanol engines have performed well and upcoming technologies will further improve on this performance,Environmental
Methanol is a liquid at ambient temperature,Environmental
However since the ash point of Methanol is very low around to deg C carriage as well handling of methanol can be hazardous would require specially designed storage tanks and would need an inert atmosphere to be maintained in the tanks all the time,Environmental
Liqueed natural gas LNG is the other choice open to maritime operators being both a proven and commercially available solution,Environmental
At present there are around ships already operating on dualfuel gas engines,Environmental
LNG is mostly comprised of Methane a highly potent GHG and far more harmful to the environment than CO,Environmental
Methane traps times more heat in the atmosphere than the same amount of CO over a year period,Environmental
LNG fell in stature after many members of the scientic community began to publish studies that examined the welltowake emissions of methane referred to as Methane slip,Environmental
Methane slip takes place mainly during aring burn off at the point of production but also at the point of consumption,Environmental
Liqueed petroleum gas LPG is a combination of Propane CH and Butane CH,Environmental
The fuel is readily available globally and is lauded as a clean energyefcient and portable fuel with an affordable price tag,Environmental
However in the wake of new technologies and techniques LPG can also be produced from renewable sources,Environmental
There are more than LPG storage facilities around the world that can be used for LPG bunkering and more than small size LPG carriers that can be used for shiptoship bunkering,Environmental
LPG is at least as attractive an energy source as LNG with shorter payback periods lower investment costs and lower sensitivity to fuel price scenarios,Environmental
So far LPG as a marine fuel has only been tried on LPG carriers,Environmental
It is unlikely that owners in sectors other than LPG will adopt the fuel widely given the increased capital cost and complexity relative to ships burning existing fuels,Environmental
Carbon Capture and Storage A complex method that involves trapping carbon dioxide emissions at its source of production or directly from the air and transporting it to a storage location usually in coal seams aquifers depleted oil and gas reservoirs and other spaces deep under the surface of the Earth,Environmental
Several oil majors as well as Shipping companies are researching solutions to lower costs,Social
If they are successful in doing so this technology has the potential to become dominant as it would imply that existing fuels can continue to be used,Environmental
Electrication SemiElectric and Electric vessels are gaining momentum energy storage in batteries and optimized power control can provide signicant reductions in fuel consumption maintenance and emissions,Environmental
While improved battery technology has helped the new generation of electric European ventures get aoat Electric and hybrid ships need more efcient and lighter batteries for a breakthrough,Environmental
Energy density has increased considerably over the last years however it is not yet enough to supply large ships with energy for long distances,Environmental
The development of charging infrastructure and technologies for faster charging of the batteries are also crucial and hence oceangoing vessels are unlikely to become completely electried soon,Environmental
Crew training at PSLs Maritime Training Center As previously reported the Company set up a fulledged Maritime Training Center at its Head Ofce in Bangkok in March,Social
The PSL Training Center includes a stateoftheart Bridge Navigation Simulator for training of maritime personnel,Social
Vesseltype specic Simulator recreates the actual maneuvering characteristics of the ship and its bridge controls as it enters a specic major port and provides ideal conditions in which Ofcers get handson experience for effective bridge teamwork and competence in shiphandling and navigation,Social
This is a signicant step taken to train and equip our Ofcers and Crew to take better care of themselves and their ships all with a view to ensuring safety of the crew cargo and the ship by preventing accidents thus helping to preserve the environment,Environmental
In the current scenario of a worldwide shortage of trained personnel and the rapid promotions that is a natural result of such a shortage this is a major step to provide specialized training that would otherwise have been acquired on the job,Social
This involved a total renewal of all projectors panels consoles and the software updated as per the requirements of our eet,Environmental
The International Convention on Standards of Training Certication and Watchkeeping for Seafarers which establishes the basic requirements for seafarers was revised in and again in June in a conference in Manila known as the Manila amendments brought about more stringent requirements for global standards of competency for seafarers,Social
The PSL training and eet department had been preparing in advance so that by the date of enforcement all vessels had seafarers with the required training and certicates on board our ships,Social
Maritime Resource Management MRM MRM is a training program for ships ofcers engineers pilots and shorebased personnel,Social
The aim is to increase knowledge about human capabilities and limitations and to reinforce positive attitudes towards safety and teamwork,Social
MRM is generally accepted to be one of the most efcient means of improving crew cooperation and minimizing the risk of accidents caused by human errors as well as failures in effective teamwork and resource management,Social
The MRM course is authorized and licensed by The Swedish Club a member of the International Group of PI Clubs and one of the few insurers providing Hull as well as PI insurance covers,Social
Apart from the MRM courses the PSL Training Center has classrooms VideoBased Training VBT and Computer based training CBT for the ship staff,Social
Courses include MRM Bridge Team Management BTM Bridge Team Competency BTC Ofcer Of the Watch OOW Chief Mate Course CMC Command Course Command Shipboard Safety Course SSC Maritime Professional Brieng MPB Maritime English training divided into course levels programs for safety and efcient ship operations of deck and engine departments,Social
The Training Center also conducts lectures on VTS Vessel Trafc Separation SMCP Standard Marine Communication Phrases within the BTM and MRM courses with the aim of developing our ofcers communication skills in communicating with a VTS ofcer using standard maritime phrases in various simulations,Social
The courses are upgraded regularly and provide a solid foundation to the Companys training activities and enable our Ofcers and Engineers to keep abreast of the latest developments in ship operations,Social
To meet the needs of trained engineers to serve on vessels tted with new generation Main Engines from MAN Diesel Turbo and Wartsila the PSL Training Center liaises very closely with the Technical Department and the engine manufacturers to continuously upgrade the training courses which were rst introduced even before the vessels were delivered,Social
Other training courses which the engineers go through before joining the ships are Engine Room Management and Competency Enhancement EMC for Senior Engineers Engineer on Watch EOW for Junior Engineers courses on stern tube sealing systems and ships cargo gears with special focus on hydraulics and Shipboard Safety The PSL Training Center also augments classroom theoretical courses with practical training wherever possible,Social
Because the new vessels acquired are tted with more fuelefcient modern engines using advanced electronic controls and technology the Companys senior engineers Electrical Ofcers and shorebased Technical Superintendents are put through the enginemakers specic training Precious Shipping Public Company Limited Bridge Team Competency II Bridge Team Competency I Bridge Team Management ECDIS Electronic Chart Display Information System Maritime Professional Brieng Maritime,Social
Resource Management Chief Mate Course Command course OOW EOW RTFlex Basic RTFlex Advance ME Advance ME Basic Basic English Elementary Maritime English Upper Intermediate English Intermediate English Shipboard Safety for Rating Maritime cybersecurity awareness courses designed to better understand the operation and for effective troubleshooting,Social
Junior engineers are in turn trained at the Companys Training Center and by trickledown methods on board ships,Social
New courses are also being introduced to prepare the ships staff for the challenges expected in the coming years on account of the low Sulphur cap carbon dioxide emissions and ballast water treatment regulations,Environmental
To equip the ofcers with knowledge of new developments the company has taken the step of organizing specialized courses conducted by experienced and procient guest teachers,Social
The use of Electronic Chart Display and Information System ECDIS has become mandatory for new ships built from July,Social
Ofcers are required to complete specialized ECDIS l generic training as part of their competency certicates,Social
PSL is committed to ensure that navigating ofcers are fully conversant with ECDIS equipment prior joining the vessel,Social
Ofcers are given generic ECDIS training at approved institutes,Social
Realizing the fact that certication alone does not make an ofcer fully familiar and condent to use ECDIS PSL Training Centre has equipped itself and developed ECDIS training familiarization courses,Social
After attending the approved ECDIS generic training course ofcers are required to undergo further ECDIS familiarization course at our inhouse facility,Social
The training department also keeps abreast of imparting awareness to Ofcers on the risks due to increased incidents of the liquefaction of cargoes such as iron ore nes coal manganese ore nes and nickel ore More than a hundred seafarers have lost their lives over the past eight years on vessels which have capsized due to the liquefaction of such cargoes,Social
The latest cargo entry in the list of solid bulk cargoes susceptible to liquefaction that can cause catastrophic results is bauxite,Environmental
When subjected to sufcient dynamic loading very wet negrained bauxites go through a process of slumping and dynamic separation with the upward expulsion of waterslurry,Environmental
This may result in free surface effect of liquid sloshing about which could signicantly affect the vessels stability leading to the risk of the ship capsizing,Environmental
In response the IMOs SubCommittee on Carriage of Cargoes and Containers issued new guidance on the carriage of bauxite requesting adequate safety precautions to be taken when carrying this cargo,Social
During the year with the Covid pandemic showing little signs of relenting we continued to train our ofcers online,Social

PSL has taken an active role in reporting to the IFC Information Fusion Centre a centre for monitoring the movement of all vessels in Southeast Asian waters,Social
The IFC is based in the Singapore Naval Base and relays information to all regional Marine Coastguard units and has been effective in tackling piracy in the region,Social
Cybersecurity As modern and technologically advanced newer ships become increasingly connected and softwaredependent on their daytoday systems cyber security continues to be a key area requiring increased attention to control operational and safety risks on these ships while remaining a major issue to be tackled by shipping companies during their board meetings worldwide,Social
We continue assessing this threat to increase our overall security posture and to nurture a secure environment within which the organization can work and minimize the risk of any security breach,Social
Cyber risk is seen as an area where the threads in the global risk environment come together and the scale and sophistication of risks keeps growing,Social
This is also fueled in part by geopolitical trends more state sponsored attacks could add to those cyberattacks that are nancially motivated,Social
Cyber exposure is growing in companies due to the rapid increase of interconnected devices due to emerging technologies use onboard ships and the use of articial Intelligence,Social
The prime focus of our industry will now be our ability to respond to these everincreasing Cyberattacks,Social
The IMO resolution MSC on Maritime Cyber Risk Management in SMS has already come into effect from st of January,Social
The Resolution states that an approved SMS should consider cyber risk management in accordance with the objectives and functional requirements of the ISM Code,Governance
It encourages administrations to ensure that proper risk assessments and measures to protect ships from cyber incidents are included in the SMS,Social
Though we have not had any cybercrime incidents till date at PSL we constantly review and maintain our ndings that Our present systems incorporated in Office environment and onboard ships are robust enough with the understanding that both IT and OT systems may be involved in cyber security incidents,Social
During we have undergone a Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing in the ofce IT infrastructure by Nettitude a subsidiary of Lloyds Register and a member of CREST which is recognized globally as the cyber assurance body for the technical security industry,Social
A vulnerability assessment was also done on a sample vessel in the eet,Social
Based on the gap analysis report we have acted and completed all the recommended measures both in the ofce and on board our ships to increase our cybersecurity posture,Social
Annual Report Additionally the integrity and vulnerability of our nancial and accounting related database is audited by EY once a year,Governance
Although most ships are now connected to the internet only permitted whitelisted websites can be accessed minimizing the risk of malware and phishing,Social
The OT systems in machinery spaces and the vital navigation equipment are segregated and not connected to the internet,Social
That minimizes if not eliminates the risk due to Cyberattacks onboard ships,Social
Nevertheless to reduce vulnerability to both cyber accidents and cyberattacks and to ensure safe and efficient operations of our eet at all levels of the company from senior management ashore to the crew onboard are involved in the safety and security culture onboard each vessel in company policies by considering how to align cyber risks with the existing security and safety risk management requirements contained in the ISPS and ISM Codes and in relevant onboard procedures by including,Social
new related requirements in inhouse training programs day to day operations of the vessel and maintenance of critical cyber systems if any that may exist onboard,Social
Digitalization During due to the Covid pandemic most employees continued to work remotely from home as was found necessary,Social
This was possible because the Management at PSL has always been fully committed to support digitalization and we had been regularly going through the process of identifying and transforming the working procedures at PSL which we are committed to continue,Social
At PSL continuous training is the key to keep staff and seafarers up to speed with new technology which we take very seriously,Social

vessels were allowed to use only Low Sulphur Fuel Oil LSFO with a maximum of sulphur content during the rst phase from January until January,Environmental
The second phase began in January when vessels in all ECAs must use fuel with a maximum sulphur content of,Environmental
The third phase which stipulates a global cap of on the sulphur content of marine fuel came into force on January,Environmental
This was initially expected to be even more challenging for some time due to the uncertainty regarding the availability and cost of compliant fuel,Environmental
The transition however was relatively smooth and now after a whole year of the regulation entering into force there seem to be no problems with the availability of the new grade of compliant fuel with sulphur content below by mass,Environmental
Shipowners had the option of installing an exhaust gas scrubber unit in which case fuel with a higher sulphur content HSFO could be used,Environmental
The scrubber would then wash down and reduce the sulphur levels in the exhaust to below levels VLSFO,Environmental
Installing of scrubber unit on vessels however presented several challenges both technical as well as nancial,Environmental
Several design aws became apparent during the past year with most of the commercially available scrubbers which frequently led to breakdowns at sea,Environmental
There were a few cases where the ships were left immobilizedincapacitated due to extensive damages to the scrubber units themselves and in certain cases also to the main propulsion machinery,Environmental
In addition several countries have banned the discharge of wash water from OpenLoop Scrubbers in their coastal waters and it is possible that these restrictions may spread globally,Environmental
With the price differential between HSFO and VLSFO progressively decreasing PSLs decision not to install scrubbers on our vessels and to consume compliant fuel only VLSFO on our vessels instead has proven to be a correct one,Environmental
The International Maritime Organization adopted the Energy Efciency Existing Ship Index EEXI and Carbon Intensity Index CII as an amendment to Marpol Annex VI which will enter into force on January,Environmental
EEXI Stands for Energy Efciency Existing Ship Index,Environmental

An important regulation that was put into force on st January was the IMO Sulphur cap regulation under which all oceangoing vessels are required to consume low Sulphur fuel oil to power their diesel engines and boilers,Environmental
As an alternative to burning low Sulphur fuel oil some Shipowners have installed Scrubbers on board their vessels enabling them to continue burning the lower grade high Sulphur fuel oil,Environmental
Scrubbers perform the function of cleaning the main engine exhaust gases but result in the production of toxic washwater,Environmental
In most cases this toxic washwater is discharged into the sea effectively transferring pollution from the air into the ocean,Environmental
Given the harmful impact of this toxic washwater on marine life most major trading nations have banned the discharge of this wash water in their harbors thereby nullifying much of the economic benet derived from this equipment,Environmental
The Company has chosen to implement the IMO Sulphur regulation by burning compliant low Sulphur fuel oil rather than installing scrubbers,Environmental
Firstly there continued to be an increased frequency of breakdowns associated with scrubbers which impacted vessel operations and therefore the earnings of vessels which have installed this equipment,Environmental
Secondly most major trading nations banned the discharge of wash water from openloop scrubbers rendering them inoperable much of the time when they reached or were in most ports,Environmental

In addition to the above the most significant regulations are outlined below and the Companys efforts to remain compliant Some of the other regulatory instruments Annual Report Learning from various marine casualties over the years ISM Code was introduced by the IMO to enhance the safe operation of ships and pollution prevention,Environmental
The Code is implemented on board the vessels and offices ashore to provide an international standard for the following objectives,Social
Ensure safety at sea,Social
Prevent human injury or loss of life,Social
Avoid damage to the environment Here is a graphical account of the Companys ISM Code violations viewed against Vessel Operating days from,Environmental
For this analysis violations are considered as any incident that results in a fire explosion serious injury or death to crew members collisions groundings etc The Company has analysed each violation in detail to identify the rootcause and initiate appropriate corrective and preventive actions,Social
The results are then conveyed to all senior employees as casestudies to avoid recurrence,Social
In we had two incidents which can be described as an ISM violation from over vessel operating days for the fleet,Social
The ISM violation in the current year includes minor collision in China with a local smallsize tanker while trying to avoid another tanker vessel which was coming close to our vessel with insignificant damage to either vessel or the environment and vessel briefly touched bottom in a confluence of bad weather and falling tides in the Mississippi river and refloated at the next high tide using tugs there was no damage to the vessel or the environment,Environmental
These incidents were discussed in the companys safety meetings to prevent a recurrence,Social
As per the ISM code requirements annual internal audits are conducted on board by a dedicated team of qualified and experienced ship auditors reporting directly to the Managing Director,Governance
All incidents of non compliances accidents and near misses are thoroughly investigated and analysed after which procedures are reviewed immediately,Social
Furthermore all lessons learned from various accidents and near miss incidents are shared with organizations like Marine Accident Reporting Scheme MARS for the mutual benefit of the industry and to enhance maritime safety in general,Social
The Nautical Institute London which publishes the MARS reports every month has appreciated the Companys participation in MARS and for promotion and sharing lessons to learn incidents and case studies from its own fleet for the benefit of the industry,Social

As such the Companys ship staff are regular tested on their ISM knowledge,Social
They are also encouraged to share experiences from across the fleet for everyones benefit,Social
Enhanced maintenance of vessels The head office has stressed that all machinery checks and inspections be carried out with greater frequency and any difference observed by ship staff are immediately reported,Social
Also the Companys management has stressed that internal auditors enforce the Code more stringently than external inspectors to achieve a higher level of compliance and safety for the Companys ships cargoes and crew,Governance
Timely warnings and reminders to vessels Vessels entering North American and Australian waters often require additional certificates for compliance with local regulations,Social
As a preventative measure the head office gives instructions to the crew well in advance of the vessels arrival in such waters to ensure that all documents are in order and the vessel is always in full compliance with regulations,Social
The Company has set an internal target of zero ISM Code violations resulting in injury or death fire collisions or groundings or any vessel detention resulting from an ISM Code violation,Social
Intercargo quoting their own words exists to link industry stakeholders in a commitment to a safe efficient and environmentally friendly dry cargo maritime industry and our vision is for a safe efficient and environmentally friendly dry cargo maritime industry where its members ships serve world trade operating competitively safely and profitably,Social
This perfectly fits in with the Companys philosophy and the Intercargo membership reflects Companys resolve towards sustainability,Social
In the Company also became a member of Right Ship an independent ship vetting organization formed by BHP Billiton Rio Tinto and Cargill three of the worlds largest transnational corporations and major users of sea transport services,Social

International Safety Management Code ISM Code Annual Report International Ship and Port Safety ISPS Code Considering changing security circumstances across the globe the International Ship and Port Safety Code was adopted in,Social
The code is an amendment to the SOLAS Convention that encompasses a greater level of security arrangements for ships and ports,Social
The code assigns responsibilities to governments shipping companies shipboard personnel and portfacility personnel to detect security threats and take preventative measures against security incidents affecting ships or port facilities used in international trade ISPS Code Part A,Social
In implementing the ISPS Code the Company has developed standard operating procedures for vessels entering ports prone to drug smuggling and stowaways,Social
This includes employing sniffer dogs and armed guards where appropriate,Social
Furthermore standard policies are employed whenever vessels call European British American Australian or Canadian ports and to date the Company has had only detention from an ISPS violation,Social
Annual internal reviews are conducted on preventative measures including the performance of the companies providing the sniffer dogs and guards,Social

IMO resolution MEPC prohibited the carriage of noncompliant fuel oil on board ships after st March unless the ship uses an alternative compliance method such as an exhaust gas cleaning system or scrubber accepted by the flag State as an alternative means to meet the sulphur limit requirement,Environmental
The IMO regulations aim to significantly reduce the amount of sulphur oxides emanating from ships and should have major health and environmental benefits for the world particularly for populations living close to ports and coasts,Environmental
On the other hand potential consequences of noncompliance even if inadvertent can be draconian including criminal liability and imprisonment significant fines exclusion from the USUKEU banking system and reputational damage,Governance
PSL has a clear policy to comply with all applicable sanctions regimes set out as under All our ships are employed on lawful trades only,Governance
PSL ships never switch off their Automatic Identification System AIS even while transiting piracy highrisk areas so our ships trading areas can be verified at all times,Social
Maritime Cyber Security Management In the Interim Guidelines for implementation of Maritime Cyber Risk published by IMO it has been agreed that no later than the first annual verification of the companys Document of Compliance after January the cyber risk management system should be incorporated into the Safety Management System,Social
We have already completed this process and a Cyber Security Manual has been included in the Companys Shipboard Operating Procedure SOP,Social
Having successfully outlined and explained the significant maritime regulations that safeguard the environment and those that will soon play a significant role the next section details the Companys internal environmental control system,Environmental
All PSL Ships need to meet these requirements Data collection requirements for GHG emissions Amendments to MARPOL Annex VI that make the data collection system DCS for fuel oil consumption of ships mandatory were adopted at the th session of the MEPC held in October and came into force from March IMO Resolution MEPC,Environmental
Upon verification of the submitted data the Flag Administration or the Recognised Organisation RO issues to the ship a Statement of Compliance related to fuel oil consumption,Environmental

periodic review and continual improvement of our SQEMS the Company hopes to elevate environmental performance over the coming years and make significant contribution to conservation of the environment and reducing the Companys carbon footprint,Environmental
Another tangible effort being made by the Company to reduce the environmental impact of the business is the adoption of new environment friendly technology on new ships acquired,Environmental
ISO Certification With an increasing demand for environmental conservation the Company has established an Environment Protection Policy In addition to minimum requirements based on international conventions and regulations the Company implements an Environment Management System EMS complying with the ISO standards,Environmental
ISO provides a framework for a holistic strategic approach to the Companys environmental policy plans and actions and demonstrates that the Company is an environmentally responsible organization,Environmental
The Company first obtained the Certificate of Environment Management Systems Registration issued by Class NK in the year as per the standards of ISO,Environmental
The EMS supplements the Quality Management System meeting ISO standard and the ISM code,Governance
This integrated Management System is known as Safety Quality and Environment Management System SQEMS,Social
According to the SQEMS the Technical Manager who also heads the Management Company is appointed as the Management Representative and is also the Designated Person for the purpose of the ISM code,Governance
Most dry bulk shipping companies do not obtain this certification which is the exclusive preserve of tanker companies where protection of the environment is the paramount issue,Environmental
We however choose to hold ourselves to a much higher non mandatory standard,Social
The Companys commitment to protection and conservation of the environment and prevention of pollution is reflected in the newbuilding vessels that the Company ordered and took delivery from various shipyards in China as explained in this Annual Report,Environmental
In addition wherever practical the vessels specifications exceed those mandated by regulations both for ease of operations as well as to enhance the vessels ability to protect and conserve the environment,Environmental
Use of New Technology and Innovations Protection and conservation of the environment Precious Shipping Public Company Limited,Environmental
Double Hull construction is utilized for DWT bulkers to minimize environmental pollution in case of accidental hull damage,Environmental
The vessels hull form was perfected after several rounds of careful design analysis using the latest technology with a view to arrive at the most optimal combination of shipsize shape to achieve the desired speed at minimum fuel consumption,Environmental
The fuel consumption of these vessels is far less than comparable sized older ships,Environmental
Such low fuel consumption is achieved by combining a highly fuelefficient main engine with a new design of slowspeed large diameter and high efficiency propeller on an optimized hull form,Environmental
To reduce carbon footprint and increase thermal efficiency of these ships the exhaust of auxiliary engines is routed through the composite boiler,Environmental
This improves wasteheat recovery and reduces the consumption of oil for the burner,Environmental
These ships were fitted with onboard treatment plants for ballast water which fully comply with IMO regulations enforced from September,Environmental
These treatment plants are designed to remove render harmless and thereby prevent transfer of harmful bacteria and invasive species of micro life through ballasting and deballasting operations between ports,Environmental
Engines fitted follow the required Nitrogen oxide NOx emission standards,Environmental
The DWT ships have flush boxtype shipsides for cargo holds,Social
This reduces accumulation of cargo residues in the holds thereby reducing the need for harmful cleaning chemicals for removal of the same since the holds can be cleaned using water only,Environmental
Deepwell sump pumps for Main Engine oil circulating system this reduces the overall quantity of lubricating oil required for the Main Engines which in due course reduces the quantities of waste oil,Environmental
The vessels were fitted with large incinerators well above the requirements of MEPC Standards to burn waste and sludge,Environmental
This ably supplements the Companys garbage and waste management system which is already in operation on all the Companys vessels,Environmental
Larger capacity Bilge watersludge storage tanks these enable environmentally friendly waste disposal ashore by allowing more flexibility in selecting the best waste disposal facilities ashore separately for oily water and sludge,Environmental
Improved biobased Sewage Treatment Plants are installed on the ships,Environmental
Ships follow the IMOs Ship Recycling Convention The Hong Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships was adopted in May,Environmental
It is aimed at ensuring that ships when being recycled after reaching the end of their operational lives do not pose any unnecessary risk to human health and safety or to the environment,Environmental
Presently the Convention is open for accession by States,Social
Though the convention has not yet come into force our fleet is already compliant with this requirement and all ships hold an International Certificate of Inventory of Hazardous Material IHM,Environmental
Ecofriendly ships Shipping is one of the cleanest and greenest industries among all international transport industries,Social
It is also an environmentally friendly and fuelefficient industry,Environmental
It is estimated that shipping carries roughly of world trade and yet according to the latest figures published in following the thGHG study international shipping is responsible for just of global CO emissions,Environmental
Shipping industry has not yet solved all its green issues,Environmental
Present endeavours of the industry and the IMO are twofold Existing Vessels Reduce intensity of carbon emissions by imposing restrictions on design as well as operational parameters,Environmental
New Vessels Use of improved hull designs and more fuelefficient engines and technology,Environmental

Presently the Companys policy is to carry out mid ocean ballast water exchange to prevent the transfer of harmful aquatic organisms at the point of discharge,Environmental
This already serves to mitigate if not totally cut out the damage to the indigenous biodiversity of the ports the Companys vessels visits,Social
The Ballast Water Management Convention came into force on September,Environmental
All new vessels keel laid from this date are required to be fitted with IMO approved ballast treatment plants,Environmental
All existing vessels are required to retrofit such plants in a phased manner along with surveys associated with first renewal of IOPP International Oil Pollution Prevention certificate after September,Environmental
The Company has already fitted Ballast Water Treatment plants on vessels in our fleet by December and the remaining vessels also will be fitted with the same by early,Environmental
Fresh Water The Company recognizes that water resources are a critical component of the ecosystems where the Company conducts its business,Environmental
The Company is committed to lowering fresh water obtained ashore,Environmental
To reduce the water received from shorebased sources the Company produces water through the freshwater generators on board each vessel,Environmental
A freshwater generator is a vital machinery system used onboard ships,Environmental
This machine is used for the conversion of seawater into freshwater by vacuum distillation based on evaporation and condensation,Environmental
However the remaining fresh water for consumption is sourced from ashore,Environmental
Arguably this eats into the fresh water supply available for communities ashore and so it is our endeavour to reduce water sourced from shorebased sources over time,Environmental
The Company has set a goal of reducing water purchased from shore based sources by by the year compared to a baseline year,Environmental
The Company will take measures to reduce water consumption on board by encouraging ships crew to minimize wastage of fresh water and maintain freshwater generators on a regular basis to maximize production of fresh water on board,Environmental
Precious Shipping Public Company Limited To formalize the Companys commitment towards preserving and conserving environment and to reduce carbon footprint the Company completed the transition audit for ISO on August and received the new ISO certification from Class NK of Japan,Environmental
The ISO provides a framework for a holistic and strategic approach to the Companys environmental policy plans and actions and will demonstrate that the Company is an environmentally responsible organization and that all operations are conducted in an environmentally sustainable manner,Environmental
From as part of the Companys commitment to the reduction of GHGs all vessels have been maintaining records of Carbon Dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuel in the engines and boilers,Environmental
The average carbon intensity per transport measured in Grams CO emitted per tonnemile was gm CO in,Environmental
The Company also operates highly fuel efficient Eco vessels where in we have achieved Grams of CO per tonnemile,Environmental
Green House Gas Emissions Green House gas emissions and Sulphur dioxide pollution have reached hitherto unseen heights and focus on the environment has become even more important,Environmental
Organizations worldover have become more environmentconscious and shipping is no exception,Environmental
Apart from the existing Emission Control Areas that require ships to burn fuels which contain no more than Sulphur another global regulation that entered into force from st January requires that the Sulphur content of marine fuel which is burnt in engines and boilers to be capped at,Environmental
The availability and quality of the low Sulphur fuel oil referred to as compliant fuel is one of the challenges that was expected to be faced by the industry in the year,Environmental
The other option being fitment of scrubber units on vessels besides being both technically and financially challenging is further in doubt as a suitable solution as these are designed to remove Sulphur pollution from the atmosphere and transfer the same as a pollutant to the seas,Environmental
The Company is committed to sustainable longterm measures to improve the environment and has therefore opted for operating the vessels with more expensive compliant fuels,Environmental
The vessels had prepared to operate with this compliant fuel by cleaning all fuel tanks sub dividing large fuel tanks into smaller tanks capable of handling smaller parcels of fuel without mixing using suitable additives and lubricants and conducting prejoining and onboard on the job training for the crew to meet these challenges,Environmental
In April the IMO adopted a resolution on the strategy of a reduction of total GHG emissions by as compared to the levels of the year,Environmental
This requires vessels to report annual fuel oil consumption worldwide to IMO through the flag administration,Environmental
This system is expected to generate reliable data to monitor and assess the progress of efforts to reduce the emission of GHGs,Environmental
All vessels have implemented both the EU MRV and IMO DCS and the data on fuel consumed and distances steamed during the year are reported to the IMO as well as the EU after verification by a Recognized Organization,Environmental

improved by retrofitting fuel saving devices like the Mewis Duct PreShrouded Vanes and Hub Vortex Absorbed Fins,Environmental
Precious Shipping Public Company Limited Further several older and less fuelefficient vessels of the fleet were replaced between the years to with Eco vessels,Environmental
Eco operation is made possible by larger cargo hauls reduced fuel consumption on account of better hull lines lower lightship and very efficient electronically controlled engines and optimized use of waste heat from the engines even the exhaust gases from the auxiliary engines is diverted through the boiler to use the available heat,Environmental
Our new Eco vessels emit approximately less CO per unit transport work as compared to the older vessels in the fleet,Environmental
At the same time the Company seriously evaluates all new developments carefully as several builders claims are often exaggerated to get fresh business and when technical parameters such as calorific value of fuel design and scantling draft and sea margins are taken into consideration the socalled benefits simply do not exist or they are not costeffective,Environmental
In any event the Company looks very closely at the machinery on all new acquisitions whether new buildings or second hand vessels and monitors their performance very carefully to arrive at optimum speed and consumption variables while ensuring that emissions are kept to a minimum,Environmental
We have made a substantial reduction in our carbon footprint and this is expected to improve further through optimization measures like shorter ballast passages and port stays larger cargo hauls and slower steaming,Environmental
In the year the average carbon intensity per transport work was estimated at Grams CO per tonnemile and in the year it was estimated at Grams CO per tonnemile which equates to a reduction of,Environmental
The Company is also a member of the Getting to Zero Coalition which aims to place zeroemission vessels in operations by,Social
As a member of the coalition the Company is carefully monitoring developments in technology in the Marine field which offer vessels which operate with zero emissions,Environmental
The range of sources of power with zero emissions is extensive but largely in the research stage,Environmental
The feverish pace of Green Technology aims to decarbonize Marine Transport by offering alternative lowcarbon and zerocarbon fuels like Biofuels Methanol Ammonia Hydrogen and innovative renewable energy options like Wind power solar power and Electric propulsion,Environmental
LNG is considered by many to be a transition fuel on the pathway to the zero carbon future of the shipping industry,Environmental
It has virtually no SOx and very low NOx emissions and as compared to fuel oil has almost a reduction is carbon dioxide emissions,Environmental
However LNG is mostly made up of Methane which is a highly potent GHG far more harmful to the environment than CO,Environmental
The use of LNG from well to wake involves a leakage of Methane to the atmosphere referred to as Methane slip,Environmental
It is estimated that for the same amount of emission Methane warms the planet times more in a short span of years as would CO in a hundred years,Environmental
Hence until a solution is found to address or substantially reduce Methane slip LNG cannot be considered as a successful option to reduce GHGs,Environmental
As the Companys commitment to the environment led to the early induction of ECO vessels it is expected that as soon as viable options of these next generation zero emission green vessels are available they will also form part of our fleet,Environmental

Food waste on board may be disposed of onshore or shredded by food waste disposer grinds food waste into small pieces and disposed of at sea beyond or nm from the nearest land,Environmental
To reduce pollution the Company continuously trains and updates crew members as well as onshore personnel on our policies and requirements for strict adherence to MARPOL and general environmental awareness,Environmental
Sludge disposal Another source of harmful substances generated by our ships consumption of fuel and diesel oil is sludge,Environmental
Sludge is a product of on board fuel oil purification and as an alternative to incinerating sludge and releasing even more harmful gasses into the environment the Company has made a substantial effort to dispose of such material to shorebased reception facilities,Environmental
This is a much more expensive way for dealing with this issue but the Company is committed to reducing its carbon footprint and reflects the Companys efforts towards environmental conservation,Environmental
Waste oil or sludge generated on each ship is about of all fuel burnt,Environmental
Empirical research suggests that every ton of oil burnt generates approximately tons of CO,Environmental
By delivering sludge to a suitable reception facility this waste can be recycled to make products like grease which is a lubricant widely used in multiple industries,Environmental
To reduce CO emission from incinerators the Company intended to deliver more sludge disposal ashore,Environmental
