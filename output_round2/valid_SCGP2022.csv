This is important in reducing greenhouse gas emissions by incorporating new innovations in both domestic and international factories especially with the use of online digital control systems,Environmental
Sensors are installed to monitor the values of different equipment in the paper production process and AI Data Analytics is utilized to analyze and control operations for maximum efficiency instead of relying on manual inspection or control by employees,Social
Examples of systems include monitoring the air flow in the Dryer Part controlling the consistency of the pulp in the paper production process and measuring the quality of wastewater,Environmental
In year SCGP implemented measures to increase water discharge efficiency from boilers in its paper production processes at plants both domestically and abroad with automated systems saving GJ of energy per year and reducing the emission of tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year,Environmental
The abroad factory PT Fajar Surya Wisesa Tbk in Indonesia has made an interesting advancement,Social
They have optimized the water extraction system from the paper,Environmental
by installing machines with new technology instead of the old system This reduces the use of electricity and antiscale chemicals,Environmental
It saves energy by gigajoules per year and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year and upgraded its wastewater treatment system from using electrical energy to an anaerobic system reducing their use of electricity,Environmental
Furthermore they have used biogas to generate electricity replacing the use of coal,Environmental
This has reduced the use of coal by tons per year reduced the emission of greenhouse gasses by tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year and saved million Baht per year in coal costs,Environmental
Another important measure is to increase the proportion of renewable energy and clean energy use instead of fossil fuel use,Environmental
In the electricity energy sources SCGP has continuously installed solar power systems every year since,Environmental
Both rooftop and groundmounted solar farms have been installed,Environmental
In the company expanded the installation of solar energy to seven other companies in Thailand adding a total of megawatts to the current capacity bringing the total capacity of solar energy production to megawatts to date,Environmental
This has helped to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year,Environmental
SCGP is working to build partnerships with communities in the provinces of Kanchanaburi Ratchaburi Suphan Buri and Petchaburi to purchase agricultural waste materials such as sugarcane leaves conversion into biomass fuel,Environmental
They are also upgrading their equipment to allow for the use of biomass fuel instead of coal,Environmental
Additionally SCGP is researching various types of biomass such as tree branches and sugarcane leaves to improve their properties so that they can be used as a fuel source that is similar to coal,Environmental
In the year SCGP has been studying and testing the use of wood pallets as a fuel source,Environmental
They have found that wood pallets have a higher calorific value than wood bark and have properties similar to coal allowing them to be used as a substitute,Environmental
By working with communities in these provinces SCGP is promoting sustainable agriculture and reducing the use of nonrenewable energy sources,Environmental
In the overall use of biofuel in the year SCGP was able to increase the use of bioenergy to replace the use of coal in steam boilers from tons per year to tons per year reducing the emission of greenhouse gases by tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year to tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year,Environmental
SCGP recognizes the importance of increasing the proportion of renewable energy and improving production efficiency in the factory to make it environmentally friendly both upstream and downstream,Environmental
It also sees the significance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions on the downstream side particularly through the continuous research and development of lowcarbon products delivered to customers and consumers,Environmental
This involves reducing the usage of raw materials resources and energy in production while ensuring that GHG removal is comprised of two measures Collaborate with national and international organizations to study carbon capture and storage CCUS technology and to increase its maturity,Environmental
Support and participate in the conservation and restoration of forests and ecosystems to increase biodiversity and provide additional carbon sequestration areas,Environmental
And economic tools are utilized such as Internal Carbon Pricing ICP to encourage the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions,Environmental
