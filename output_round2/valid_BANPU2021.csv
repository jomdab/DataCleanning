Taiwan imported more coal in since its economy was less affected by COVID,Environmental
High global demand for Taiwanese chips prompted the country to increase manufacturing and export pushing up its demand for electricity,Environmental
Like China Taiwan was hit by heatwaves and a decline in hydroelectricity generation capacity while high LNG prices further contributed to increased coal demand for electricity generation,Environmental
However Taiwan and South Korea similarly imposed restrictions on coalfired power generation to reduce air pollution,Environmental
As a result limits on coalfired power plant operations between October and March have curbed the countrys growth of coal consumption,Environmental
Southeast Asian countries economies recovered in as well however coal imports shrank as Vietnam cut imports of coal,Environmental
On the contrary the Philippines coal imports grew as the government eased its lockdown measures causing electricity consumption to rise,Environmental
Other Southeast Asian countries coal imports remained relatively the same as the previous year as they still maintained their COVID prevention measures albeit less stringent,Environmental
Several countries started relaxing their COVID measures after the majority of their population had received vaccines,Social
Since October Chinas coal production has increased dramatically but it took over three months for supply and demand to be in equilibrium,Environmental
In December the mild weather and stricter measures to combat the Omicron Covid variant resulted in lower power consumption making way for a balance between demand and supply,Environmental
On July the Chinese government announced the National Emissions Trading Scheme ETS with an aim to reduce CO emissions,Environmental

According to its Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources Indonesian coal production in totaled million tonnes increasing by from last year even with yearround heavy rainfalls,Environmental
Given coal being an essential primary commodity coal industry was loosen from the governments COVID control measures,Environmental
However it was indirectly affected by the restrictions on the transportation of workers resulting in delayed deliveries of mining machinery and equipment since manufacturers had to comply with the governments stringent measures consequently leading to a disruption in raw material supply chain,Social
Labor and equipment shortages which occurred as a result of the governments measures hit small producers harder than the larger ones,Social
According to Indonesias Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources the countrys coal exports in were at million tonnes rising yearonyear as demand for coal imports from China increased after Chinese government had imposed bans on Australian coal imports prompting importers to rely more on Indonesian coal,Environmental
So India and Vietnam remained main markets of Indonesian coal,Environmental
The Indonesian government enforced a nationwide lockdown from July to control the spread of the Delta Covid covering most of the country and more than million population,Social
Nonetheless power consumption did not decrease because most manufacturing plants had kept their machines running even when they had to comply with stringent COVID measures,Environmental
The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources reported that domestic coal consumption in was at million tonnes increasing from last year,Environmental
Coal consumption in the steel industry saw a significant upward trend since many new iron and steel plants gradually completed their construction and started their operations,Environmental
With Chinas prolonged ban on Australian coal Indonesia became Chinas major coal supplier,Environmental
Nonetheless Russia benefited from Chinas ban on Australian coal imports since it could export more coal to China,Environmental
With its highquality coal Russia could also expand coal exports to other Asian countries,Environmental
The Republic of South Africas rail transportation of coal faced a challenge due to frequent cable thefts which hampered its coal transportation,Environmental
Governance Certification of Information and Data Accuracy On the other hand other industries such as paper petrochemicals textiles and food as well as coal traders importing coal for stock and sales had coal consumption and coal import for stockpiling in the first ten months of at about million tonnes increasing yearonyear,Social
China remained the worlds largest coal importer with a total import volume of approximately million tonnes rising from the previous year as supply shortfall pressured the government to relax import control and allow more coal imports,Environmental
On top of that Chinese governments ban on Australian coal urged importers to import coal from other countries,Environmental
India imported less coal despite economic recovery from the COVID slump,Environmental
Therefore coal producers had been trying as much as possible to export coal,Environmental
Furthermore heavy rainfalls in Indonesia barred many coal producers from meeting their production targets,Environmental
The government wanted coal companies to comply with the Domestic Market Obligation DMO which requires coal companies to fulfill domestic coal needs before exporting,Environmental
On December the Indonesian government announced a temporary ban on coal exports from to January in bid to divert coal supply to power plants and allow them to secure a minimum of day stock level,Environmental
In addition challenges in sourcing coal according to the power plants quality requirements and limited unloading capacity at the plants made it even more difficult for them to increase their stock level within the specified time,Environmental
To curb GHG emissions the Indonesian government announced a carbon tax last year which would initially be imposed on power plants starting April,Environmental
According to the new measure any power plant with emissions above a set limit is subject to a carbon tax of IDR or about USD per tonne of CO equivalent COe,Environmental
As the carbon tax rate is low coalfired power plants should remain competitive,Environmental

Chinas ban on Australian coal benefited Russian coal exporters as China turned to import more coal from Russia driving Chinas imports of Russian coal to grow by yearonyear in the first month period of,Environmental
The surging demand from China coupled with the obstacles in rail transportation consequently tightened the supply of Russian coal,Environmental
Nonetheless the COVID pandemic had caused disruption in several areas along the coal supply chain for instance labor and mining of million tonnes in approximate though most economies in this region started recovering from the COVID pandemic,Social
This prompted power producers to reduce costs by substituting coal for natural gas as coal was a cheaper fuel option,Environmental
However since developed countries are focusing more on renewable energy and limiting coal consumption the growth will slow down,Environmental
Yet coal consumption in developing countries will continue to grow because coal remains a cheap fuel option,Environmental
In the long run the global coal demand is declining due to international efforts to reduce GHG emissions urging countries to phase out their use of coal for power generation,Environmental
Investment in new coal mines will decrease accordingly and coal producers will face financing obstacles as financial institutions have been gradually shifting away from thermal coal,Environmental
On top of that the future development of new coal reserves which is likely to be affected by more stringent environmental policies and increasing public opposition will force coal producers to seek bigger returns on investment,Environmental
However as existing coalfired power plants will continue their operations to the end of their lifetime coal production is still needed to supply coal to these power plants,Environmental
Being an open market the country was a destination where some Indonesian producers released their coal supply,Environmental
More than of the coal used in the private sector was imported coal,Environmental
In the first ten months of imported coal consumption was at million tonnes increasing yearonyear due to economic recovery,Environmental
Consumption of domestically produced coal was at million tonnes growing yearonyear,Environmental
Approximately of imported coal was consumed by independent power producers with longterm power purchase contracts with foreign producers,Environmental
Nevertheless supply chain disruption the COVID pandemic heavy rainfalls in Indonesia and Australia and rail transportation problems in Russia and South Africa had caused a tight supply,Social
Most of them are major coal producers owning highquality coal resources,Environmental
As many financial institutions have ceased financing coal business in an effort to curb CO emissions there will be fewer coal producers in the future,Environmental
Due to the COVID pandemic ways of working have been changed,Social
