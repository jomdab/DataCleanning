The reported absolute GHG emission scope increased by from due to the inclusion of hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants which has high emission factor and NH Hotel Groups nonrenewable energy usage,Environmental
However absolute GHG emissions scope and decreased by and comparative to respectively,Environmental
