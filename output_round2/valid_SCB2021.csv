Furthermore if some regions of the world lag in vaccination progress new and more severe strains may emerge,Social
Second supply chain disruptions have persisted longer than expected causing inflation to soar in many countries,Social
Supply chains have failed to match recovering demand in recent years due to the Delta outbreak in productionbased countries in East Asia where stringent lockdowns and factory closures led to shortages of product and raw materials insufficient labor due to the pandemic and government benefits that discourage workers from returning to the job market shipping delays and overcrowded ports which severely affect transport of durable goods and low investment in new projects leading to supply,Social
Prices might remain high but upticks should slow as factories in East Asia resume operation and vaccination progress helps governments contain outbreaks,Social
Labor shortages should also be resolved as government benefits gradually expire and COVID concerns subside,Social
Wage hikes in some sectors would motivate more workers to return to the labor market,Social
The Bank has applied statistical tools to determine industry limits such as the HerfindahlHirschman Index HHI which is an index adopted for measuring industry concentration,Social

Reputational risk Maintaining an organizations reputation is a critical part of running a business especially for any financial business and the Banks reputation results from the confidence and trust that have been built up over many years,Governance
Reputation is not easy to build and is easy to lose,Social
Recognizing the importance of reputational risk SCB has developed a Reputational Risk Management Guideline and Process which is applied to the Bank and SCB Financial Group companies,Governance
Financial companies that are highly exposed to reputational risk must implement a reputation risk management policy with a clear reputational risk management process whereas companies with nonmaterial reputational risks are required to report any reputational risk incidents to senior management,Governance
The Marketing Function is responsible for working closely with other internal functions and SCB Financial Group companies to determine reputational risk factors as well as for assessing and reporting reputational risk issues to the senior management and related committees,Governance
People risk People risk refers to an organizations exposure to risk from the actions or negligence of its people and vice versa the risks to people from an organizations actions or negligence,Social

The People Function together with business functions and relevant support functions is responsible for identifying people risks based on appropriate analysis given the business complexity of each function as well as for assessing controlling monitoring and reporting risks to the Banks management with periodic reviews and updates regarding potential risks,Governance
The people risk management framework involves three major considerations,Governance
People capability and capacity SCBs business approach is based on transforming employees and equipping them with the right skills and capabilities for future banking as well as engaging them with the work and performance of the functions,Social
The Bank expands the scope of employees decisionmaking authority increases their capabilities and provides learning opportunities and a conducive working environment to enable them to reach their fullest potential,Social
People conduct SCBs business approach is based on requiring all employees to adhere to the highest level of integrity promoting risk ownership defining accountabilities and collaboration among business units for a positive work culture objectively achieving positive employee relations and good governance,Governance
The Bank accepts complaints and grievances including via the Whistle Blower The Siam Commercial Bank Public Company Limited Policy,Governance
The committee considers the matter and initiates a prevention plan,Governance
The Bank upholds the utmost privacy of the employees with regard to the privacy act,Governance
People health and safety SCBs business approach is based on a strong commitment to creating a safe working environment for people with due consideration to both physical and emotional health extending to employees families and communities,Social
Failure to put any of the above considerations into practice may lead to varying degrees of people risk depending on the situation,Social
Therefore it is critical to assess control and mitigate people risks to within the Banks risk appetite,Governance
People are vital resources in the banking business,Social
Therefore the Bank needs people capacity and capability to help achieve its business goals in a sustainable manner,Social
SCB duly recognizes the importance of human resources which have been subject to significant and constant challenges in todays environment,Social
A key challenge is the advent of new technologies which may replace existing service delivery platforms and put pressure on an organization to reform or transform itself,Social
Such broadscale organizational change increases the demands on human resources in terms of both quality and quantity,Social
Specifically an organization requires knowledgeable wellrounded and adaptable people to drive change within the organization,Social
SCB has taken measures to mitigate such risks by building a risk culture whereby risk awareness and ownership are the norm and risk mitigation and prevention are the responsibilities of all staff,Governance
Moreover the Bank set up SCB Academy to build additional skills and knowledge for its people such as product knowledge and data analytics skills related to business analysis and planning,Social
as well as putting an emphasis on helping people build their career paths to ensure business success and sustainable growth,Social

Emerging Risk Importance Impact to the Bank Management approach Risks from climate change and approaches to achieving Carbon Neutrality SCB has closely monitored the global coalition and the commitment of financial institutions worldwide to reach Carbon Neutrality by,Environmental
In this regard Thailand took an important milestone in when the government joined the th UN Climate Change Conference COP and pledged to accomplish Carbon Neutrality by with provision of support on finance and technology as well as international cooperation,Environmental
Since the new goal is years earlier than Thailands initial Carbon Neutrality commitment by the Bank has examined potential transition risks which could arrive ahead of the plan particularly regulatory changes and government policy to mitigate GHG emissions,Environmental
U n d e r s u c h circumstances certain projects not aligned to or supporting a decarbonization target might face constraints as well as adverse impacts on asset values and operating costs due to regulatory changes especially the Given potential regulatory shifts toward GHG management there might be longterm impacts on project finance whereby a business model or technology does not align with the Carbon Neutrality target,Environmental
Certain projects with high risks are heavy polluters such as coal mining and unconventional petroleum production,Environmental
SCB recognizes that the Carbon Neutrality ambition could deter competitiveness of companies that face constraints in adopting clean technology or reshaping the business model to accommodate the target both within firms and along the supply chain,Environmental
Any regulatory changes or financial measures related to GHG reduction will likely affect the business performance and expansion strategy of SCB clients thus causing ripple effects onto the Bank if we end up failing to present financial solutions as planned,Environmental
Considering the estimated impacts SCB adopts the Equator Principles which require every largescale project finance with high environmental impact and annual GHG emissions of over tons of carbon dioxide equivalent to undergo and report climate risk assessment both in terms of transition and physical risks,Environmental
By doing so any project finance will reveal potential environmental impacts and thus enable appropriate solutions and concrete management plans,Environmental
