International Maritime Organization IMO conventions are constantly updated to match demands for enhancedstepstoprotecttheenvironmentIMOastheregulationontheglobalcaponsulphurlevelsis referred to colloquially entered into force on January,Social
The regulation mandated that sulphur levels in fuel oils consumed by ships outside emission control areas not to exceed by mass referred to as Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil or VLSFO,Environmental
There remain some concerns regarding the quality of VLSFO being supplied at several ports and suitability for use on ships equipment that were designed primarily for use with fuels with higher sulphur levels which contributed towards lubricity as well as optimum viscosity,Environmental
The alternative to VLSFO was installing Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems also referred to as exhaust gas scrubbers or simply scrubbers in which case vessels could continue using high sulphur fuel oils HSFO Sulphurcontentofuptoandthescrubberswouldthenbeexpectedtowashdownandscrubtheexhaust gases to reduce the sulphur content to below levels,Environmental
The inherent drawback with such a system was that the wash water which would have to be discharged at sea would contain all the additional sulphur in the form of sulphuric and sulphurous acids thereby polluting the seas instead,Environmental
Several countries the world over have already banned discharging of wash water in their territorial waters thereby requiring owners going with the scrubber option to carry on board adequate reserves of VLSFO in addition to HSFO,Environmental
Ships need to take ballast basically sea water in dedicated ballast tanks on board so that the ship remains stable when there is no cargo on board and so that the ships propeller is kept well submerged in the water,Environmental
Administrations of most countries in the world insist on stringent ballast water management practices on board ships so that potentially invasive aquatic life forms from one part of the world do not get deposited in their waters thereby affecting the local ecosystem,Environmental
Hence the need for regulations that require ships to treat the ballast water taken in the ballast tanks by means of approved Ballast Water Treatment Systems BWTS which need to be installed on board,Environmental

New marine fuels derived from abundant untapped renewable resources could bring substantial developmentgainsbutwillrequiresignificantchangestoshipsportsandoperations Future Fuels Biofuels could play a valuable role in reducing CO emissions from the marine sector over the next few years,Environmental
From a technological perspective they are the easiest to adopt as they can be blended with existing marinefuelsandutilizedbyexistingvesselsBiofuelswouldalsonotrequiresignificantdeliveryinfrastructure investment,Social
However Biofuels are likely to be the preferred fuel for the aviation and road sectors given the high energy density relative to alternative clean fuels and therefore there simply may not be adequate volumes available to the marine sector over the longterm,Environmental
That said Biofuel blends are likely to gain traction in the coming years as this is the easiest shortterm solution to reducing carbon emissions in the marine sector,Environmental
Hydrogen as a fuel is attractive because it emits no carbon or other pollutants when used,Environmental
Existing hydrogenmanufacturescanproduceblueorlowcarbonhydrogenbycapturingandstoringthecarbon emittedduringtheproductionprocessHoweverresearchisunderwaytodevelopenergyefficientprocesses forproducinggreenhydrogenfromwaterviathermochemicalprocessesusingrenewableenergyAnother potential approach to produce carbonneutral fuels involves chemically processing green hydrogen together with carbon or nitrogen to produce gaseous or liquid fuel,Environmental

Ammonia While it could be several years before it is adopted at scale Ammonia does enjoy the privilege of having the largest share of zeroemission vessel prototype projects worldwide,Environmental
Its molecular makeup NH allows for a carbon and sulphurfree combustion,Environmental
Today most commercially available Ammonia is derived from fossil fuels which makes its green credentials less than pristine,Environmental
That will change once Ammonia is produced at ANNUAL REPORT Precious Shipping Public Company Limited scale through a renewable energy powered electrolysis process a development that is expected to take place in the latter half of this decade,Environmental
Early adopters of Ammonia as a fuel are likely to be Niche vessels operating inregionswithstrictemissioncontrolsandonfixedroutesAmmoniaTankersandLPGTankerscapableof transporting Ammonia,Environmental
This will likely be followed by energy guzzlers such as large Cruise and Container carriers on routes where Ammonia as fuel is easily available,Environmental
Bulk carriers which consume about of total marine fuel consumed globally will unlikely be early adopters because of their varied trade routes,Environmental
The key to the adoption of Ammoniapowered vessels would be the establishment of safety and training standards which could take several years given the more complex nature of the fuel,Social
Methanol is a safe costeffective and globally available marine fuel with global production of MMT,Environmental
However it could be renewable as it can be produced from a variety of renewable feedstocks or as an electrofuel,Environmental
Methanol fuel produces no sulphur emissions very low levels of nitrogen oxide emissions and is biodegradable,Environmental
It can also be blended into existing fossil fuels,Environmental
Current dual fuel Methanol engines have performed well and upcoming technologies will further improve on this performance,Environmental
Like existing marine fuels such as heavy fuel oil HFO Methanol is liquid at ambient temperature and therefore relatively easy to store and distribute,Environmental
Liquefied natural gas LNG is the other choice open to maritime operators being both a proven and commercially available solution,Environmental
At present there are around ships already operating on dualfuel gas engines,Environmental
LNG is mostly comprised of Methane a highly potent GHG and far more harmful to the environment than CO,Environmental

Liquefied petroleum gas LPG is a combination of Propane CH and Butane CH,Environmental
The fuel is readilyavailablegloballyandislaudedasacleanenergyefficientandportablefuelwithanaffordableprice tag,Environmental
However in the wake of new technologies and techniques LPG can also be produced from renewable sources,Environmental
There are more than LPG storage facilities around the world that can be used for LPG bunkering and more than small size LPG carriers that can be used for shiptoship bunkering,Environmental
LPG is at least as attractive an energy source as LNG with shorter payback periods lower investment costs and lower sensitivity to fuel price scenarios,Environmental
So far LPG as a marine fuel has only been tried on LPG carriers,Environmental
It is unlikely that owners in sectors other than LPG will adopt the fuel widely given the increased capital cost and complexity relative to ships burning existing fuels,Environmental
Carbon Capture and Storage A complex method that involves trapping carbon dioxide emissions at its source of production or directly from the air and transporting it to a storage location usually in coal seams aquifers depleted oil and gas reservoirs and other spaces deep under the surface of the Earth,Environmental
Several oil majors as well as Shipping companies are researching solutions to lower costs,Social

In August the IMO released the longawaited Fourth IMO Greenhouse Gas Study,Environmental
On a positive note through the years to the carbon intensity of international shipping improved roughly by and the total GHG emissions from shipping dropped by despite a growth in maritime trade,Environmental
However during the years to the total GHG emissions from maritime shipping rose from MMT to MMT while shortlived climate pollutants like black carbon and methane emissions rose by and respectively,Environmental
