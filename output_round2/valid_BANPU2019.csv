China remained the worlds largest coal importer despite the restrictions of coal imports from the government,Environmental
Coal production in early slowed down due to stricter enforcement of safety measures as there had been fatal mine accidents,Social
The Chinese governments stringent mining safety regulations also forced some mines to shut down temporarily for a safety inspection,Social
Although the government had urged highsafety coal mines to accelerate their production the output increased slowly,Environmental
Chinas coal imports surged in January following the restrictions on coal imports over the past year,Environmental
China reduced valueadded tax on the import of coal from to since April,Environmental
Coal imports in China soared in the third and the fourth quarters after buyers speeded up importing fearing that the government would curb coal imports as at the end of,Environmental
Coal imports at the time were also much cheaper than domestic coal,Environmental
Meanwhile domestic coal output was higher when the coal mines suspended for safety inspection passed a safety inspection and resumed their production,Social
Annual Report Banpu Public Company Limited baseload power plants,Environmental
Summarily India saw an increase in coal imports over the past year,Environmental
Japan consumed less coal than in because nuclear and renewablebased power plants had achieved greater capacity while some baseload power plants were during overhauling,Environmental
South Korea had been facing air pollution particularly fine dust and the government had to shut down four old coalfired power plants with a total generation capacity GW from March to June,Environmental
Other power plants were ordered to operate of the capacity while the governmentowned power plants had to alternate their operations for an overhaul to reduce dust emission causing a sharp decline in coal consumption during the first half of,Environmental
Apart from that the South Korean government adjusted the tax system for coal and liquefied natural gas LNG to cut down coal use which will partially help reduce air pollution,Environmental
Customs tariff increased by according to types of coal while those of LNG dropped from KRW to KRW per kilogram or a decrease,Environmental
Despite the change in the import tax system coal is still the cheapest fuel for power production compared to other commercial fuels,Environmental
Moreover most of the LNG supply is based on a longterm purchase agreement to ensure energy security,Environmental
China India North Asia Southeast Asia Other Asia Europe Rest of World Million Tonnes Increase Decrease Annual Report Banpu Public Company Limited In the latter half of coal consumption in South Korea increased significantly because of better weather and the overhaul of nuclear power plants,Environmental
However the National Council on Climate and Air Quality suggested the government shut down several base load power plants over December February to reduce air pollution,Environmental
The government subsequently ordered baseload power plants to shut down during that period and the rest of baseload power plants to scale down their operations to of their capacity,Environmental
The electricity authority was delegated to manage to electricity supply to satisfy the demand,Environmental
The restriction on baseload power generation has caused a decline in the overall coal consumption in South Korea,Environmental
Taiwan likewise suffered from dust problems thus limited baseload power plant production at a total capacity of GW during winter,Environmental
Apart from that the local government ordered that Taichung the largest coalfired power plant in Taiwan with a GW net capacity which used to consume about million tonnes Mt of coal per year reduce the consumption of coal to no more than Mt per year,Environmental
Taichung Power Plant still maintained the production of some units to stabilize the power transmission system,Environmental
This situation caused the Electricity Authority of Taiwan to discuss with the local government about further solutions,Environmental
In the next few years Taichung Power Plant will scale down coal consumption within the amount set by the local government,Environmental
This was driven by rising electricity demand after the new baseload power plant achieved COD with a GW generation capacity,Environmental
In addition since domestic coal supply was insufficient for the growing demand coal users needed to import coal to blend with domestic coal,Environmental
However there was more gasfired power generation while gas prices falling and carbon prices rising,Environmental
The continuous increase in renewablesbased power generation also dragged down coal power generation,Environmental
Many countries in Europe accelerated the plan to cancel coal to achieve the GHGs reduction target,Environmental
At the COP UN climate conference at the end of the European Union announced the European Green Deal aiming for netzero GHG emissions by which will drive the decline of coal in the future,Environmental
Together with fewer rainfalls last year there was a high surplus of coal in Indonesia despite the governments restriction on coal production,Environmental
There was an Annual Report Banpu Public Company Limited expansion of the coaltransporting Vostochny seaport so that more coal can be transported to Asia,Environmental
Though there was a bottleneck of coal transportation by train the development of seaports along the coast of the Black Sea to accommodate large ocean freighters enabled Russia to increase coal export,Environmental
The largest share of went to China increasing over,Social
Increase Decrease Annual Report Banpu Public Company Limited,Governance
The government expects to better audit taxation and prevent illicit coal production and trading,Social
Meanwhile the cement industry remained the largest coal consumer accounting for approximately Mt of the private sectors coal consumption decreasing Mt yearonyear,Environmental
Independent power producer IPP is the secondlargest group of coal consumers whose consumption was at Mt growing Mt yearonyear despite economic slowdown because baseload power generation has the lowest costs when compared with power generation from other commercial fuel sources,Environmental
Coal Consumption by Sector Source Marketing Sales and Logistics Analyst Banpu Plc,Social
Annual Report Banpu Public Company Limited China remained the worlds largest coal importer with an import volume of approximately Mt rising from the previous year despite the Chinese governments stricter restrictions on coal imports and a continual increase in domestic production,Environmental
Nonetheless imported coal delivered to the east coast of China remained cheaper than domestic coal resulting in such a high import volume that the government had to intervene,Environmental
The Chinese governments stricter control on coal imports caused a sharp drop in coal imports in the last two months of,Environmental
Asian countries imported around Mt of coal falling from last year,Environmental
In this group South Korea was the largest importer as the government limited baseload power production over winter to cut dust pollution,Environmental
Meanwhile Taiwan also suffered air pollution and the government likewise restricted operations of coalfired power plants,Environmental
Nevertheless Taiwan has less power generation capacity than South Korea thus its proportion of reduced coal imports was lower,Environmental
Japan imported more coal from Russia and Canada while being less dependent on Australia and Indonesia to raise the bargaining power,Social
South Korea and Taiwan bought more premium coal to reduce the severity of the dust problems which partially urged them to consume less coal,Environmental
Annual Report Banpu Public Company Limited Europes coal imports dropped from the past year,Environmental
Coal imports into Spain the UK Italy and France plunged due to falling natural gas prices and more renewable power generation,Environmental
Australia producers also suffered extended customs clearance in China thus burdening additional costs on export from Australia,Social
Indonesia Other USA South Africa Colombia Russia Australia Million Tonnes Russia exported approximately Mt of coal to Non CIS countries increasing over the past year,Environmental
As Russia has successfully expanded its coal terminals it could export more coal to Asia especially to Vietnam the Philippines and Thailand,Environmental
Consequently Russia has higher competitiveness in Turkey the Mediterranean India and Pakistan,Social
