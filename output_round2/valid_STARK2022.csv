Progress on our roadmap to net zero scope Supporting decarbonization in the construction industry Product documentation for building LCA Carbon emissions are released during the prod uct manufacturing transportation construction and endoflife phases commonly referred to as embodied carbon,Environmental
To reach net zero there is an urgent need for coordinated actions across the value chain to design and produce lowcarbon building materials that can be reused or recycled after enduse to reduce this embodied carbon,Environmental
As a leading building materials supplier we have the potential to reduce carbon emissions in the construction industry by promoting lowcarbon products and services,Environmental
The decisions made for buildings during the planning and construction phase largely determine the environmental impact over many future decades due to the long lifetime of buildings,Environmental
Therefore our ambition is to become involved at an early stage to promote the most sustainable material solutions,Environmental

Emission conversions and calculations The STARK Group environmental reporting tool is set up to convert the business data into standard units of measure for each activity,Environmental

Carbon base year recalculation principles STARK Groups base year and subsequent year inventories are adjusted for mergers acquisitions and divestitures according to guidance as set forth in the WRIWBCSD GHG Protocol,Environmental
Data must be includedexcluded in carbon accounts within months of closing an acquisition or divestment,Environmental
When significant structural changes occur during the middle of the year the base year emissions are recalculated for the entire year rather than only for the remainder of the reporting period after the structural change occurred in line with the Greenhouse Gas protocol,Environmental
Similarly current year emissions are recalculated for the entire year to maintain consistency with the base year recalculation,Environmental
STARK Groups base year inventory and emissions reports for subsequent years are updated when a significant cumulative change in STARK Groups base year emissions is triggered,Environmental
Significant is defined as a cumulative change of five percent or more in STARK Groups total base year emissions total of scope and on a COe basis,Environmental
In cases where STARK Group has acquired a com pany and base year data for the newly acquired company is not available the absolute month energy fuel waste and water consumption at the acquisition year will be used to calculate carbon emissions in the base year assuming that energy fuel and water consumption as well as waste production has been constant,Environmental
This is done by adding the absolute consumption to the baseline consumption which is subsequently multiplied by the emission factors from the base year to obtain the restated carbon emissions,Environmental
This calculation method is viewed as a conservative estimation for a baseline datapoint as energy efficiency initia tives driven by the EU Energy Efficiency Directive and cost savings since baseline are likely to have occurred,Environmental
All associated procedures and calculations are documented and assurance for carbon scope and on the restated baseline are obtained,Environmental
We strive to keep estimations at a minimum and aim to improve data quality when entering new contracts,Social
