Developing water reuse system to handle severe drought in by supporting community water management along with educating farmers and those returning to their hometown due to the COVID outbreak about agriculture and encouraging the government to extend the effort across the country as a means to restore community economy and increase agricultural output enabling Thailand to become the kitchen of the world,Environmental
Waste to Wealth Constructing Check Dams to Restore Ecological Balance Climate Resilience Projects Constructing Check Dams to Restore Ecological Balance SCG has adopted His Majesty the Late King Bhumibol Adulyadejs sustainable water management approach in its operations for more than years and has continued preserved and built upon the royal legacy on Water is life through the Conserving Water from Mountain to Mighty River project,Environmental
The initiative aims to empower the community to solve drought and flooding problems by engaging the community in the process allowing the locals to fully understand water management in their areas,Environmental
The construction of check dams in the once arid land helps retain moisture in watershed forest and restore ecological balance,Environmental
It also helps solve drought and flooding as well as store water for consumption by navigating water down to connected ponds in the foothills or distributing water on lowland through the Monkey Cheek water retention system to allow farmers to fully utilize water in agriculture,Environmental
Throughout the past years SCG and communities have constructed a total of check dams resulting in the restoration of nature and stable job creation,Social
For instance Ban Sa Phae Neur Community in Chae Hom Lampang Province faced severe drought in causing rice paddies to die,Environmental
By working collaboratively with SCG through the learning and sharing of knowledge and ideas the community was engaged in solving the problem of water shortage starting off with the construction of check dams followed by sand dams and concrete connected ponds to store water,Environmental
The endeavor resulted in the community having water for irrigation all year round compared to the past when farmers could grow crops only three months a year during the rainy season with their income increasing four times,Environmental
The construction of check dams not only helps retain moisture and restore forest land to health it also captures carbon dioxide the main culprit of global warming,Environmental
Promoting Zeroburning Agriculture by to minimize PM dust and generate income for farmers by transforming agricultural waste such as rice stubble sugarcane leaves and corn cobs into biomass animal feeds and packaging together with providing technology support to increase farm output through the establishment of community funds to create steady income,Environmental
Advancing plastic waste management to be a national agenda by revamping laws on waste management taking concrete actions and engaging all sectors to operate concurrently on top of introducing measures to support recycled products and offer tax incentives for entrepreneurs dealing in plastic waste recycling,Environmental
