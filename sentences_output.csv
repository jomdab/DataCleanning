Dear Shareholders,
Amid the economic challenges, AIS commits to developing digital  
infrastructure in pursuit of delivering the finest service experience to 
customers. 
"
41,"2022 was a year our Thai economy gradually recovered in the wake of the acceleration in economic activity following 
the subsided COVID-19 pandemic."
42,"However, the macroeconomic factors and the fast-changing global situation brought 
on by a confluence of factors, including rising energy costs and increasing inflation posed challenges to all sectors 
in Thailand."
43,"Regardless of such difficulties, AIS has remained fully committed to continuously improving the service experiences by differentiating services’ quality and standards to support Thailand’s digital economic activities and the customers’ growing demands for technological advances prompted by digital disruption.
"
44,"With an investment of 30 billion baht in 2022, AIS achieved its target to expand the 5G network to cover 85%  
of the total Thai population together with developing a full-service 5G ecosystem, resulting in the exponential growth 
of 5G users in this year."
45,We also invested to expand the home broadband network to allow more users in remote areas to access AIS Fibre services.
46,These endeavors were instrumental in driving Thailand’s digital economy and contributing enormously to our achievement of the business targets.
47,"“AIS strives to grow from a Digital Life Service Provider 
towards becoming a Cognitive Tech-Co amid 
the economic volatility to address the needs and effectively 
deliver superior services excellence to our customers”

48,"GovernanceManagement StructureInternal ControlFinancial StatementIn addition to accelerating growth in our core businesses, we are determined 
to continue improving the capabilities of our human capital and enhance 
internal cost management and control to cope with the rising cost 
challenges."
49,"Last year, we incorporated digital technology into the work 
processes together with cost optimization program so that the economic 
conditions would not limit us to pass on superior services to customers and 
deliver great returns to all shareholders."
50,"In 2022, AIS achieved a net profit 
of 26,011 million baht and paid out a total of 22,872 million baht in dividends, accounting for 88% of the year’s net profit.
"
51,"Fostering a robust digital ecosystem by  
partnering with multiple sectors to create  
mutual growth and deliver the highest privileges 
for our customers.
"
52,"On top of being at the forefront as a digital service provider, AIS pledges  
to be a leader in the development of the digital ecosystem."
53,"The digitalization 
efforts through efficient infrastructure and digital ecosystem which can 
cater to various applications have been enhancing our potential and 
competitiveness and helping us to achieve mutual growth for all parties.  
"
54,"In the previous year, with our cooperation with various partners, AIS 
developed and improved our product and service portfolio to consolidate the digital ecosystem in Thailand; central to these are:
5G Nextgen:  A platform that allows the Thai business sectors to explore 
and apply 5G-enabled solutions that best suit their businesses to streamline 
work processes and enhance competitiveness in different spheres."
55,AIS CloudX:  
56,"Drawing upon collaborative efforts with our partners with 
unrivaled expertise, the product supports enterprise clients’ flexible cloud 
management."
57,"The distinctive capability of connecting to other digital 
infrastructure and the 5G network securely and conveniently offers a more 
friendly alternative for enterprise customers to access a highly secured 
cloud service.
"
58,Data Center:  
59,"In 2022, Gulf, Singtel and AIS entered into an agreement to 
establish a data center business to cater for fast growing digital usage in Thailand."
60,"This dynamic growth has made Thailand an attractive target for the digital investment of multiple hyperscalers and opened opportunities for AIS to thrive in new growth areas in the future.
"
61,"Aside from the digital ecosystem, we are dedicated to developing a more 
diverse and comprehensive privilege and point ecosystem to elevate service 
experiences and values for our customers."
62,"As such, in 2022 we established 
partnerships with allies in several industries including Bangchak Group, 
Central Group, Citibank Group, and Krungthai Bank."
63,"Such efforts are part 
of AIS’ key strategies for fostering strong ties between AIS and customers 
which helps strengthen AIS’ competitiveness for the long term.
"
64,"Priming for the next challenges with the  
transformation towards Cognitive Tech-Co
Although it is anticipated that the Thai and global economies will face a 
myriad of risks and challenges in 2023, AIS is relentless in transforming 
ourselves from a Digital Life Service Provider into a Cognitive Tech-Co to ensure all stakeholders that notwithstanding economic volatility or 
any disruption, AIS’ business operations and service delivery are poised 
to address the demand and deliver an exceptional service experience to 
customers effectively."
65,"This will be made possible by driving the development 
of the three key pillars: (1) Autonomous Network, (2) IT Intelligent, and  
(3) Data Insight & Customer Care to deliver products and services that 
answer customers’ latent needs."
66,"We believe that the development in these 
three core areas will raise customers’ experience of AIS services to a whole 
new level and consolidate all its core businesses, empowering them to 
propel the growth of digital activities in Thailand, gain competitive edges, and sustain growth for many years to come.
"
67,"Maintaining sustainability targets in three  
dimensions to grow sustainably together with 
all stakeholders

alongside sustainable development."

operations are intertwined with sustainability goals under the concept of

growth between mankind and the environment, spanning in three dimensions: 
1) driving digital economy, 2) promoting digital inclusion, and 3) acting on 
climate."
69,"These three dimensions of the sustainable development framework 
are believed to stimulate everyone in Thailand to embark upon the digital economy with concern for the environment."

Accommodate Growing Demand for 5G among Users and 
Organizations
In 2022, mobile operators expanded their 5G networks to cover 77 provinces. 
"
508,"However, key areas with a high density of demand were major cities in different  
regions such as Bangkok Metropolitan Region and the Eastern Economic 
Corridor (EEC) which saw higher demand for 5G than elsewhere."
509,"Over the past 
year, 5G adoption reached 6.8 million subscribers."
510,"This could be attributable  
to the rollout of new 5G-enabled handset models at more affordable prices 
and the operators’ introduction of cheaper 5G promotional packages to 
create reach and drive 5G adoption."
511,"Other contributing factors included  
the changing behavior of consumers with demand for more efficient  
technologies than the 4G, fueling 5G adoption to grow by leaps and bounds.
"
512,"In response to the increasing role of 5G for end-users and B2B clients, AIS 
pledged to develop its 5G network to gain competitive edge in coverage and 
quality and highlight the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of AIS’ 5G products

quarter of the year, directly impacting consumers’ cost of living."
518,"While this 
resulted in the dampened purchasing power of those with lower buying 
power and the vulnerable groups, consumers with high purchasing power 
seemed to be less affected as a result of the recovery in economic activities 
as well as tourism and hospitality following the easing of new COVID-19 
infections and measures.
"
519,"The total revenue of the mobile industry remained unchanged, amounting to 
Bt 320,000 million due to intense market competition, prompted by operators’ 
focus on price competition to maintain their customer bases and expand market shares."
520,"As such, they offered unlimited data plans at lower prices 
for prepaid and postpaid customers, resulting in lower average revenue per 
user (ARPU) for the industry despite a 6% increase in the number of users, 
5% of whom were prepaid customers and 7% postpaid."

Mobile Business Expected to Recover Following Revival of

in Inflation
The Thai economy in 2023 is expected to regain momentum, propelled by a 
surge in tourist arrivals combined with slowdown in inflation as central banks 
in many countries continue to raise interest rates."
526,"The Bank of Thailand has 
projected the inflation rate to be 3%, down from the surge of 6.3% in 2022. 
"
527,"This coupled with a rebound in tourism as forecast by the Tourism Authority 
of Thailand with the number of foreign tourists in 2023 rising to 25 million will be a key driver behind Thai economic recovery, contributing to higher 
purchasing power and domestic consumption."
528,"Such favorable factors could 
help drive the overall revenue of the mobile industry.
"
529,"Price competition continues to pose a challenge to any rebound in revenue 
within the industry next year."

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the home broadband market witnessed 
solid growth following demand for work and learning online from home in response to changing consumer behaviors and lifestyles."
536,"Despite the fall in COVID-19 cases, consumers’ rising demand together with Thailand’s digital expansion helped drive the growth of the home broadband business."
537,"As at 
year-end 2022, the home broadband industry amounted to Bt 68,000 million, 
up 2% from the preceding year."
538,"The number of home internet increased 
to 13 million households with the penetration rate reaching 58% of total  
households in Thailand."
539,"Nevertheless, given the higher inflation and cost 
of living, service providers were pressured to offer low-price packages, 
starting at Bt 299/month."
540,"Discounts were also offered to customers or 
those switching service providers to maintain customer bases and expand 
market shares, resulting in the continued decline in the industry’s ARPU. 
"
541,"In response, service providers were relentless in selecting products and 
additional services to add value to their products.
"
542,"Over the past year, AIS offered several value-added services to customers. 
"
543,"Examples included fixed mobile convergence (FMC) that allows cell phone 
sets to function with home internet, providing a variety of content, and

providers to generate more revenues from sales of digital enterprise  
solutions such as cloud products and services, cyber security, data center, 
Internet of Things (IoT), and ICT solutions."
547,"This has brought about steady 
growth in the enterprise client market."

and enable efficient organizational management."
555,"Following a major  
transformation of work patterns during the COVID-19 outbreak, organizations 
in both the government and business sectors have increasingly come to

"
562,"AIS sets it sights on encouraging more users to adopt 5G in 2023 backed 
by wide-ranging strategies such as a rollout of 5G packages suitable for 
each group of customers, or packages bundled with a new handset."
563,"Aside 
from general users, AIS anticipates that 5G technology will play a vital role in facilitating the business operations of enterprise clients, expanding the 
commercial opportunities of 5G services brought about by an increase in the 
use of solutions and services in the target industries such as long-distance 
control, real-time tracking systems, unmanned vehicles, and smart factories 
among others."
564,The efforts align with AIS’ role in supporting and facilitating the adoption of digital technology to elevate the work of enterprise clients and grow alongside AIS.
565,Home Broadband
566,"Anticipating Sustained Growth
The home broadband market in Thailand is expected to sustain its growth as people have increasingly realized the importance of digital lifestyles and 
rushed to install home broadband during the spread of COVID-19 over the past 
few years."
567,"Another contributing factor is that 58% of households in Thailand 
have fixed broadband connectivity, demonstrating high growth potential, 
especially in suburban areas with no access to internet connectivity."
568,"Also, 
service providers tend to roll out a more diverse range of packages, for 
example, fixed-mobile convergence, home internet packages bundled with 
IoT devices, and home solution packages to address the digital needs of 
consumers."
569,"Given these positive factors, the number of users and revenue of home broadband business in 2023 are expected to grow robustly.
"

AIS’ acquisition of Triple Three Broadband Internet (3BB) by AWN, a subsidiary  
of AIS dedicated to providing home internet service."

the process of requesting approval from the National Broadcasting and

Regulations and Orders of Regulators
AIS operates under the supervision of government agencies such 
as NBTC, the organization responsible for regulating operators  
under granted license in the telecommunications industry and with the legal authority to issue rules, regulations and orders to regulate 
licensees."
747,"Rules, regulations, and orders issued in the future, such 
as those that relate to amending tariff structures and service fees 
or measures for consumer protection, have the potential to affect 
the Company’s business operations, reduce the Company’s ability to generate profit and/or increase the cost of services.
"
748,"For any work directly related to government agencies, AIS has  
a dedicated unit responsible for regularly monitoring the issuance  
and change of regulations and reporting such changes to management  
and coordinating with relevant departments to ensure they  
are informed promptly and are ready to respond."
749,"The unit’s role 
includes acting as an intermediary to coordinate with government 
agencies and ensuring that it is given all the necessary information  
on the business impact of regulations."

this unit, the Company also has the opportunity to make comments or suggestions and/or raise concerns or opposition to the enactment 
of laws, rules, regulations and/or orders in the event that they are 
deemed likely to have a serious impact on the Company’s operations, or to have been unlawfully conducted.2."
752,"Ri sks Arising from Disputes with Government 
Agencies
In the past, AIS operated a business providing telecommunications 
services under concession agreement with State Enterprises."
753,"This 
required the transfer of assets which the Company had invested  
for use in its business operations to government contracting parties as well as the implementation of revenue sharing models at specified rates."
754,"Formerly, AIS encountered a number of disputes arising from 
disagreement in the interpretation of Agreements such as the amount 
of revenue to be shared."
755,"In some cases, NBTC announcements, regulations or orders resulted in impacting upon AIS business 
operations or concerns for compliance to the extent that it could 
affect business operation or operating income and/or increase service 
costs."
756,"In many cases, AIS exercised its right under the law to sue  
the NBTC in a court of law in order to contest the legitimacy of the actions undertaken by the NBTC."
757,"(Information and additional details are shown under the topic Legal Disputes)
"
758,"AIS established a department that is directly responsible for coordinating 
with government agencies so that the Company as a contract party can conduct its business correctly and in complete compliance with 
relevant contracts."
759,"In the event of a conflict, the Company would 
enter into negotiations with the aim of seeking a prompt settlement.  
"
760,"In the event that the issue could not be resolved through negotiation, 
the dispute would be entered into the dispute resolution process  
by the arbitral tribunal as specified in the Agreement."

776,"Moreover, there has been an increase 
in new services that may substitute services currently provided  
by the Company, such as internet service via satellite.

Executive Summary
Maintaining growth in core products amid 
cautious economic recovery
2022 displayed an easing COVID-19 situation with a rebound of foreign tourists 
which boosted Thailand’s economic recovery."
1170,"Nonetheless, domestic demand 
stayed soft due to the global geopolitical conflicts that created accelerated 
inflation and a decline in consumer purchasing power."
1171,"Through challenges 
from various factors, AIS delivered core service revenue growth of 1.6% YoY, with the momentum of Fixed Broadband and Enterprise businesses which 
rose on digitization demand from home and business customers."
1172,"The mobile 
business leadership was sustained with AIS focusing on quality acquisition 
and profitable segments despite continued intense competition."
1173,"The postpaid 
segment further developed a positive momentum and contributed a larger pie YoY in revenue share.
"
1174,"Accelerated 5G users with superior network and 
service experiences
With our aim to deliver a superior customer experience in coverage and 
quality, we executed 5G network rollouts utilizing 700MHz and 2600 MHz 
spectrum to cover 85% of the population in 2022."
1175,"Our effort drove 5G 
adoption to 6.8mn users, above the target of 5mn."
1176,"This represents 15%  
of total subscribers."
1177,The ARPU uplift of 5G subscribers stayed about 10-15%.
1178,"AIS believes that our competitive edge in quality and 5G network strengths 
has enabled us to achieve a sustained mobile performance."
1179,"Mobile revenue 
reported Bt116,696mn, a slight decline of -0.5% YoY from growth in quality postpaid customers while streamlining the offers of prepaid packages."
1180,"Broadband and Enterprise business remains  
a strong growth engine
Broadband revenue maintained its growth momentum with an increased 
subscriber base amid a price-competitive environment."
1181,"The revenue recorded 
at Bt10,064mn, an increase of 19% YoY. AIS focuses on a fixed-mobile-content 
convergence (FMC) strategy alongside consistent service standards and 
introducing advanced technology via smart routers to enhance the home experience for AIS Fibre’s customers. 
"
1182,"The non-mobile enterprise business rode well on the digitization trend leveraging on a strong foundation of strategic partnerships that form  
a strong ecosystem with newly introduced products and platforms."
1183,"We 
helped enterprise customers by delivering specific smart solutions and 
transforming their operations effectively."
1184,"Consequently, we recorded 
Bt5,251mn in revenue, growing 26% YoY. 
Soften EBITDA from cost pressure
AIS EBITDA in FY22 was Bt89,731mn, dropped -1.8%YoY mostly from a surging 
electricity price and continued 5G network expansions."

through quality revenue and efficient cost 
allocation
2023 will be a year of transformation towards a Cognitive Tech-Co that 
aims to streamline and transform every operation to best provide superior experiences for the customers."
1187,"AIS expects to grow core service revenue at around 3-5% with the main drivers from FBB and Enterprise, while cost 
optimization will be the key engine to grow EBITDA at mid-single digit growth. 
"
1188,"CAPEX is estimated between Bt27-30bn for growth opportunities in core 
business and to sustain our network leadership.
"
1189,"Market and Competitive Environment
The Thai economy in FY22 started off with a positive tone of post-pandemic recovery with the tourist and hospitality-related sectors mostly benefiting 
from the border re-openings."
1190,"However, towards the middle of the year, 
the rising inflation and continuous increase in energy costs limited private consumption and signaled a global economic slowdown, raising spending concerns across all businesses and homes.
"
1191,"The mobile competition landscape in FY22 remained difficult for most 
operators maintaining their low-price packages to grow and retain the 
customer base."
1192,"AIS executed price discipline since 3Q22 by removing the 
freebies in the entry-level package while taking cautious steps to uplift 
the ARPU."
1193,"However, the fragile cost-concern environment, especially for  
price-sensitive segments, limited the result and brought down the ARPU 83

affordable 5G devices available in the market to create a 5G ecosystem."
1197,"As a result, the industry’s 5G users grew significantly in FY22.
"
1198,"The home broadband market continued to expand with genuine demand for 
quality broadband at home but also faced intense competition from low-price 
packages starting at Bt299 offering throughout the year amid economic 
challenges and causing an incessant drop in the broadband industry ARPU.

1199,"While some operators focus on lowering prices to compete, some executed 
a convergence strategy offering product bundling with more value-added products and differentiated services promoting superior quality to acquire the market share.
"
1200,"Enterprise business grew well riding on the demand for digitalization. 
"
1201,"Customers seek to transform with smart solutions to improve the efficiency

macroeconomic conditions with higher inflation and energy cost affected the cost of living and pushed the 4Q22 blended ARPU downward -4.6%YoY.

by expanded service coverage to more suburban areas with affordable entry 
packages while providing superior connectivity and service quality, as well as 
our efforts to reduce the churn rate."

the information from existing subscribers using Pre-Paid Mobile Service prior to the announcement date of the Notification of NBTC Re: The Criteria for the Allocation of Numbers B.E. 2551 coming into force on 
24 October 2008, within 180 days from the effective date of this NBTC Notification.  "
1541,"Under this lawsuit, AIS particularly requested revocation of the order requiring AIS to pay administrative fines of 80,000 Baht  
per day commencing on 6 July 2012 until the Company had completely performed all requested obligations.
"
1542,"Result of case On 19 November 2015, the Central Administrative Court reached its judgment which was to revoke the resolution and overturn the administrative fines on the grounds that such order enforced the operators 
to retrospectively store subscriber data which included the personal information that the subscribers were required to disclose without any measure for enforcement by service suspension or termination. 
"
1543,"With a large number of subscribers, it would be difficult to perform the requested actions without cooperation from the subscribers."
1544,"In this regard, NBTC’s resolution and order were unlawful because NBTC used power and discretion beyond the scope of regulatory duties, which created a huge burden on the operators.

2430,"As part of an audit in accordance with TSAs, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professiona l 
skepticism throughout the audit."
2431,"I also:  
 
 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatem ent of the consolidated and separate financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design a nd perform audit procedures responsive to those 
risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  
"
2432,"The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resultin g 
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery , intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the  
override of internal control.  
"
2433," Obtain an understanding of internal control relevan t to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the Group’s and the Company’s inte rnal control. 
"
2434," Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies  used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates and related disclosures made by managemen t.  
 Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use  of the going concern basis of accounting and, 
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a mat erial uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the G roup’s and the Company’s ability to continue as  
a going concern."
2435,"If I conclude that a material unce rtainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my 
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated and separate financial statements or, if 
such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opini on."
2436,"My conclusions are based on the audit 
evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s re port."
2437,"However, future events or conditions may 
cause the Group and the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.  
"
2438," Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and co ntent of the consolidated and separate financial 
statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated and separate financial statements 
represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.  
"
2439,
2440,"Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regard ing the financial information of the entities or 
business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.  
"
2441,"I am responsible for the direction, supervision and  performance of the group audit."

"
2620,"The financial statements are prepared in accordance with Thai Financial Reporting Standards (“TFRS”), 
guidelines promulgated by the Federation of Account ing Professions and applicable rules and 
regulations of the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission."
2621,"The financial statements are presented in 
Thai Baht, which is the Company’s functional curren cy."
2622,"The accounting policies, described in the notes , 
have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements.  
 
"
2623,"The preparation of financial statements in conformity with TFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect t he application of the Group’s accounting policies. 
"
2624,Actual results may differ from these estimates.
2625,"Est imates and underlying assumptions that are describe d 
in each note are reviewed on an ongoing basis."
2626,"Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised prospectively.  
 
"
2627,"3. CHANGE  IN  ACCOUNTING  POLICY 
From January 1, 2022, the Group has adopted TFRS 9 Financial Instruments and TFRS 7 Financial 
Instruments: Disclosures which have been amended in respect to Interbank Offer Rate (IBOR) reform - 
Phase 2 (Phase 2 amendments)."
2628,"The detail of the accounting policies are disclosed in note 4(c).  
 "
2629,"The Phase 2 amendments are applicable when an existing interest rate benchmark is replaced by another 
interest rate benchmark."
2630,"The Phase 2 amendments pro vide a practical expedient that modifications to 
asset and liability values as a direct consequence of the interest rate benchmark reform and the new basis for determining the contractual cash flows is economically equivalent to the previous basis (i.e. the basis 
immediately preceding the change), can be accounted for by only updating the effective interest rate.  
 
"
2631,"Additionally, hedge accounting is not discontinued solely because of the replacement of another intere st 
rate benchmark."
2632,"Hedging relationships (and related documentation) must instead be amended to reflect modifications to the hedged item, hedging instrument and hedged risk. 
"
2633,"4. SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  POLICIES 
 
"
2634,"The financial statements have been prepared under the measurement basis of historical cost except as disclosed in the significant accounting policies as follows:

the “Group”) and the Group’s interests in its associates and joint ventures.

fair value, depending on the classification of the financial assets. 
"

order to collect contractual cash flows; and 
•"
2679,"The contractual terms of the financial asset give  rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely 
payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. 
"
2680,"By default, all other financial assets are measured  subsequently at fair value through profit or loss 
(FVTPL). 
"
2681,"Despite the foregoing, the Group and the Company may make the following irrevocable 
election/designation at initial recognition of a financial asset; 
• The Group and the Company may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value of 
an equity investment in other comprehensive income if certain criteria are met (see (2) below); and 
• The Group and the Company may irrevocably designa te a debt investment that meets the amortised 
cost or FVTOCI criteria as measured at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an 
accounting mismatch (see (3) below).

contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination. 
"
2686,"Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI are initially measured at fair value plus transaction 
costs. 
"
2687,"Subsequently, they are measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair 
value recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the investments revaluation 
reserve."
2688,"The cumulative gain or loss is not be clas sified to profit or loss on disposal of the equity 
investments, instead, it is transferred to retained  earnings.

 Financial liabilities 
All financial liabilities are measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest met hod 
or at FVTPL. 
"
2708,"A financial liability may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if; 
"
2709,"Such designation eliminates or significantly reduce s a measurement or recognition inconsistency 
that would otherwise arise; or 
"
2710,"The financial liability is managed and its performa nce is evaluated on a fair value basis, in 
accordance with the Group’s and the Company’s docum ented risk management or investment 
strategy, and information about the grouping is provided internally on that basis. 
"
2711,"Financial liabilities measured subsequently at amortised cost. 
"
2712,"The effective interest method is a method of calcul ating the amortised cost of a financial liability a nd of 
allocating interest expense over the relevant period."
2713,"The effective interest rate is the rate that exa ctly 
discounts estimated future cash payments (including  all fees and points paid or received that form an

 Hedge accounting 
The Group designates certain derivatives as hedging  instruments in respect of interest rate risk in ca sh 
flow hedges."
2723,"At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging 
instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk  management objectives and its strategy for 
undertaking various hedge transactions."
2724,"Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging inst rument is effective in offsetting changes in fair 
value or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, which is when the hedging 
relationships meet all of the following hedge effec tiveness requirements; 
"
2725,"There is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument; 
"
2726,"The effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that economic 
relationships; and 
"
2727,"The hedged ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the 
hedged item that the Group actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the Group 
actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item . 
"
2728,"Interest rate benchmark reform  
When the basis of determining the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or financial liability 
measured at amortised cost changed as a result of i nterest rate benchmark reform (IBOR reform), the 
Group first updated the effective interest rate of the financial asset or financial liability to refle ct the 
change that is required by IBOR reform."
2729,"If there were any other additional changes, the Group applied 
the policies on accounting for modifications to tho se changes. 
 
"
2730,"Hedges directly affected by IBOR reform  
 
When the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of the hedged item or hedging instrument changes as a result of IBOR reform and therefore th ere is no longer uncertainty arising about the cash 
flows of the hedged item or the hedging instrument, the Group amends the hedge documentation of that 
hedging relationship to reflect the changes required by IBOR reform."
2731,"For this purpose, the hedge 
designation is amended once the following changes: 
- designating an alternative benchmark rate as the hedged risk; 
- updating the description of the hedged item, including the description of the designated portion of  
the cash flows or fair value being hedged 
 
The Group amends the formal hedge documentation by the end of the reporting period during which a 
change required by IBOR reform is made to the hedged risk, hedge item or hedging instrument."
2732,"These 
amendments in the formal hedge documentation do not constitute the discontinuation of the hedging 
relationship or the designation of a new hedging re lationship.  
 
"
2733,"If changes are made in addition to those changes required by IBOR reform, then the Group first 
considers whether those additional changes result in the discontinuation of the hedge accounting 
relationship."
2734,"If the additional changes do not result in the discontinuation of the hedge accounting 
relationship, then the Group amends the formal hedge documentation for changes required by IBOR 
reform as mentioned above.

2736,"When the interest rate benchmark on which the hedge d future cash flows had been based is changed as 
required by IBOR reform, for the purpose of determi ning whether the hedged future cash flows are 
expected to occur, the Group deems that the hedging  reserve recognised in OCI for that hedging 
relationship is based on the alternative benchmark rate on which the hedged future cash flows will be 
based. 
 
"
2737,"Cash flow hedges 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives and other qualifying hedging instrum ents 
that are designated and qualified as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income.

hedging instrument in cash flow hedging relationshi ps."
2739,"The change in fair value of the forward element 
of interest rate swap is recognised in a cash flow hedging reserve within equity. 
 
"
2740,"For all other hedged forecast transactions, the amo unt accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve is

"
2741,"If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge  accounting or the hedging instrument is sold, expi red, 
is terminated or is exercised, then hedge accountin g is discontinued prospectively."
2742,"When hedge 
accounting for cash flow hedges is discontinued, th e amount that has been accumulated in the cash flow 
hedging reserve remains in equity until, for a hedge of a transaction resulting in the recognition of a 
non-financial item, it is included in the non-finan cial item’s cost on its initial recognition or, for  other 
cash flow hedges, it is reclassified to profit or loss in the same period or periods as the hedged exp ected 
future cash flows affect profit or loss.

"
2782,"The lease term has changed or there is a significant event or change in circumstances resulting in a 
change in the assessment of exercise of a purchase option, in which case the lease liability is 
remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate. 
"
2783,"The lease payments change due to changes in an inde x or rate or a change in expected payment 
under a guaranteed residual value, in which cases t he lease liability is remeasured by discounting 
the revised lease payments using an unchanged discount rate (unless the lease payments change is 
due to a change in a yield interest rate, in which case a revised discount rate is used). 
"
2784,
2785,"A lease contract is modified and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in 
which case the lease liability is remeasured based on the lease term of the modified lease by discounting the revised lease payments using a revi sed discount rate at the effective date of the 
modification. 
"
2786,"The right-of-use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease 
payments made at or before the commencement day, less any lease incentives received and any initial 
direct costs."
2787,"They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment 
losses. 
"
2788,"Whenever the Group and the Company incur an obligation for costs to dismantle and remove a leased 
asset, restore the site on which it is located or r estore the underlying asset to the condition required by

"
2800,"The Group as lessor 
The Group enters into lease agreements as a lessor with respect to some of space and equipment.

3288,"FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS 
Financial risk management policies 
Risk management is integral to the whole business o f the Group and the Company."
3289,"The Group and  
the Company have a system of controls in place to c reate an acceptable balance between the cost of ris ks 
occurring and the cost of managing the risks."
3290,"The m anagement continually monitors the Group’s and the 
Company’s risk management process to ensure that an  appropriate balance between risk and control is 
achieved. 
"
3291,"Capital management 
The Group and the Company aim to manage its capital  structure to be stronger than industry peer and 
commit to be investment grade rating."
3292,"This will all ow the Group and the Company to retain superior 
financial flexibility in order to capture future growth prospect."
3293,"The Group’s and the Company’s financ ial 
flexibility means diversified source of capital, ease of funding, and appropriate cost of capital. 
"
3294,"Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk is the risk that future movements in market interest rates will affect the results of the 
Group’s and the Company’s operations and their cash  flows because some of loan interest rates are 
floating interest rate."
3295,"The Group and the Company h ave interest rate risk from their borrowings (see 
Note 19)."
3296,"The Group and the Company mitigate this r isk by ensuring that the majority of its borrowings 
are at fixed interest rates and uses derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps , to 
manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on specific borrowings. 
"
3297,"Interest rate swap contracts 
Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agree s to exchange the difference between fixed and 
floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed  notional principal amounts."
3298,"Such contracts enable 
the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of issued fixed rate debt held 
and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held."
3299,"The fair value of interest rate swa ps 
at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the repor ting 
date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below."
3300,"The average interest rate i s based 
on the outstanding balances at the end of the finan cial year. 
"
3301,"As the critical terms of the interest rate swap con tracts and their corresponding hedged items are the  
same, the Group performs a qualitative assessment of effectiveness and it is expected that the value o f 
the interest rate swap contracts and the value of t he corresponding hedged items will systematically 
change in opposite direction in response to movements in the underlying interest rates."
3302,"The main sourc e 
of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedge relationships is the effect of the counterparty and the Group’ s 
own credit risk on the fair value of the interest r ate swap contracts, which is not reflected in the f air 
value of the hedged item attributable to the change  in interest rates."
3303,"No other sources of ineffective ness 
emerged from these hedging relationships.

the NBTC office filed a lawsuit, under Black case N o. 661/2560, against the Company for the same 
amount to the Central Administration Court, ordering the Company to pay revenue during the customer 
protection period. 
"
3417,"On June 12, 2020, the Central Administrative Court revoked the NBTC’s order on the grounds that 
during the 900 MHz’s customer protection period, th e Company’s expenses incurred from the service 
exceeded the revenues generated. 
"
3418,"On July 8, 2020 and July 17, 2020, the NBTC and the  NBTC office appealed to the Supreme 
Administrative Court."
3419,"The Company’s management has considered that the Co mpany has complied with NBTC announcement 
regarding the Temporary Customer Protection Plan Following the Expiration of the Agreement for 
operations (“Telecommunication Service Agreement”) and the Company was obliged to submit the 
revenue after deducting any expenses to NBTC office but the Company’s expenses incurred from the 
service was greater than the revenue."

NBTC Office as stipulated in the announcement.

3422,"According to NT's views, the Company has to collect the rental charge s of the transmission system at the rate specified by 
NT, which is higher than the rate that the Company charged to the tenant.   
"
3423,"On December 19, 2022, the Company received the award by the Arbitration Committee to revoke NT’s 
dispute claims under the reason that such claims re garding the rental charges of the transmission syst em 
were disputes in relation to the compliance with th e NBTC’s notification and not the disputes in relat ion 
to the Concession Agreement.  
"
3424,"The Company’ s management believes that the Company has correctly complied with the relating 
conditions of the Agreement in all respects, therefore the outcome of the dispute should not materially 
impact the financial statements of the Company.
