232,"AIS Shops offer the most comprehensive range of products, services, and after sales services when compared with other channels."
233,They focus on distribution to customers in densely populated urban areas and maintaining a positive image of AIS products and its services.
234,Distributors: AIS has cooperated with a variety of distributors in order to cover the needs of a wide range of customers throughout the country.

246,"Our preference for personalization gives our customers the best possible user experience, while also setting us apart from our competitors and their services to ensure the maximum potential is achieved throughout every aspect of our operations."
247,Our devotion to customer relations can be AIS Shop Distributors Direct Sales Online Channels ● Other Platform Services Providing platform services is part of the vision of AIS in working with our partners to develop services that create value for our customers.
248,"Relying on the strength of the AIS customer base of over 41 million and our cooperation with business partners possessing specific expertise in a variety of fields, we are able to create new service platforms that focus on specific customer segments, generating revenue both in the form of fees and revenue sharing from services."
249,"In the past year, AIS platforms have begun offering commercial services, including gaming platforms, advertising platforms, and insurance sales platforms, among others."
250,Distribution and Distribution Channels and Services AIS distribution channels are divided into 4 main categories as follows: 29 Advanced Info Service Public Company Limited categorized into the following 5 key areas: 1.
251,"Providing services with digital technologies that are utilized in order to raise the bar in terms of the products on offer to our customers, including: ��The “Full-E” service aims at increasing convenience for a full range of services, including monitoring information, making payments, and sending receipts and billing information, all of which are available in one place, through the myAIS application."
252,"The application can ease the stress involved with various customer services, such as in cases of losing a bill, being unable to make payment in the allotted time period, not being able to travel to a designated payment office and being unable to look back through traditional service receipts."
253,"The “Full-E” service provides assistance in all these areas to ensure a comfortable, time-efficient user experience for our customers, while also reducing the reliance on paper, through incorporating the following services: ���eBills: Giving customers the opportunity to check their billing information via their mobile phone in the form of an SMS notification that allows immediate access to said information."
254,"���ePay: Increasing the scope of online payment channels for our customers, enabling them to pay via banking applications, through the ‘Rabbit LINE Pay’ electronic wallet, and with automated monthly payments from any bank."
255,���eReceipt: Letting our customers view receipts through the application for a period of up to three months.
256,"��Taking care of our customer’s personal data security in the best possible way is achieved through efficient and highly accurate facial recognition technology, meaning our customers can rest easy, safe in the knowledge that their personal information is safely secured."
257,"This technology is set up for a new telephone number registration available at over 20,000 official AIS shops, Telewiz stores and AIS Buddy branches located throughout the country."
258,"Furthermore, AIS is the first organization in Thailand to have installed facial recognition technology at 80 of our service kiosks in 67 of our AIS shops, in order to improve efficiency in terms of registering new telephone numbers."
259,"��The “Ask Aunjai” virtual agent has been developed to combine artificial intelligence (AI), chatbots, and smart knowledge base technologies in order to respond to customer queries online and through social media platforms, including the AIS website and the myAIS application."
260,"The service is available 24 hours a day and has brought an increased sense of humanity, which gives our customers the feeling that they are interacting with an actual member of staff."
261,“Ask Aunjai” improves customer service speed at the same time as providing specific solutions to issues while letting our staff focus on more valuable duties efficiently.
262,“AIS Privileges” are seen as a vital component of how we respond to the needs of each individual AIS customer using our services on a daily basis.
263,AIS is therefore committed to the continuous development of new and creative ways of providing both AIS and AIS Fiber customers located throughout the country with rewards in the form of numerous special privilege programs.
264,"The “7 great times with AIS Privileges” offers our customers great deals for use across every dimension of their lifestyles, including at restaurants, coffee shops, and shopping malls, as well as at entertainment and tourism establishments."
265,"Such special privileges are valuable discounts that can be used anywhere, at any time of day, and we are currently working alongside over 25,000 partner stores country-wide to provide over 15 million privileges each year."
266,"AIS customers can also exchange the AIS points they have collected through payment for our services for additional reductions, for example, exchanging points for 30-50% discounts on food and drink at our famous restaurant partners, for reductions on tickets to see movies at Major cinemas throughout the country, for free internet and call packages, and for mobile phone price reductions."
267,"As of now, there are 9 million AIS telephone numbers signed up to the AIS points program."
268,30 Annual Report 2018 2018* 2017 Human touch point satisfaction scores 83 percent 88 percent Non-human touch point satisfaction scores 72 percent 76 percent *Satisfaction scores for 2018 cannot be compared directly with the results of 2017 due to changes in measurement methods for greater accuracy and relevance.
269,"In 2017, the scoring used a 3-point system (1 = very good, 2 = good, 3 = need improvement) whereby the “very good” and “good” ratings were included in our calculation."
270,"In 2018, the scoring used a 5-point system (5 = extremely satisfied, 4 = satisfied, 3 = moderate, 2 = unsatisfied, 1 = extremely unsatisfied) and only included the “extremely satisfied” in the calculation."
271,"“AIS Serenade” is a special privilege program aimed specifically at high spending AIS customers as well as customers who have been using AIS services for a certain length of time, underlining our long-term commitment to these customer groups."
272,"The Serenade program has been a constant feature of our company for the past 14 years, and it is one part of our drive to improve the provision of services and privileges under “The Ultimate Life Experience” concept."
273,"An increasing number of special rewards are being offered to our Serenade customers, including the maximum possible privileges in terms of services, entertainment, business and many more besides, such as special offers at restaurants, tourist hotspots, exclusive parking spaces, airport lounge access and even personal assistants."
274,"Over the past year, AIS has expanded its Serenade Club to 13 different locations across Bangkok and in other large cities, so that we can guarantee the most exclusive experience possible for our Serenade members who have increased in number from 4.5 million to the current total of 5.2 million people."
275,"In our quest to strive constantly for the best possible customer experience, AIS has been working hard in terms of developing our analysis and understanding of consumer behaviors."
276,"We have therefore made alterations to our marketing model, including the way we present our products and services by placing an emphasis on “building value” for our customer base."
277,"To this end, we have begun utilizing a tool called customer value management (CVM) to study our customers’ behavior, in order to respond effectively to their needs."
278,"Moreover, this study and analysis allows us to present each customer base with products that are tailor-made to their specific requirements, helping us to increase consumer satisfaction at the same time as carefully managing AIS customer relations."
279,"AIS allows customers to register their level of satisfaction with our services across numerous platforms, including telephone ratings, surveys corresponding to satisfaction levels in our stores, or questionnaires arranged by external organizations."
280,"These ratings refer to the quality of services on offer from AIS, whether in our stores, at our dealerships, or through our automated service machines, as well as measuring the likelihood of our customers suggesting AIS and our services to others."
281,These data can then be used to constantly and consistently develop every facet of the services we provide.
282,"From our analysis, we have been able to summarize customer satisfaction levels as follows: 31 Advanced Info Service Public Company Limited Complete industry transition from a concession scheme to a license scheme In the months of August and October, the NBTC auctioned out 1800MHz and 900MHz spectrum licenses, respectively."
283,Part of these were the final lot of frequencies remaining from the previously expired concession.
284,"AIS and DTAC were the winners of this spectrum license auction, resulting in the Thai telecommunications system finally completing its transitioning from a concession scheme to a license scheme."
285,"In addition to the use of spectrum licenses, all three operators have entered into a business partnership agreement with state enterprises (TOT and CAT), joining together to co-utilize the frequencies of which the state enterprises have the right to operate."
286,"This also includes assets delivered under the concessions, such as telecommunications towers and other network equipment, in order to make use of unexpired assets, delay unnecessary repeat investments, and enhance network service efficiency."
287,"INDUSTRY COMPETITION 2018 & OUTLOOK 2019 Continued growth of 4G usage, but revenue restrained by unlimited plans At the end of 2018, customers using 4G technology accounted for approximately 60% of industry subscriber base, showing growth from the previous year when numbers were below 50%."
288,"However, revenue in the mobile phone industry showed a growth rate of approximately 3%; down from the previous year’s growth rate of 6%."
289,"In Thailand, the mobile phone user penetration rate was within the 130–140% range, reflecting a fairly saturated market in terms of number of users."
290,"These numbers have resulted in service provider competition for the retention of existing customers, as well as continual competition for customer share in the market."
291,"Meanwhile, price competition in the past year focused on offering unlimited data usage packages, particularly fixed-speed unlimited data packages, ranging from 1–6 Mbps, with these gaining greater popularity among customers due to the ability to use data without limit concerns."
292,"Attractive discounts on handset prices have remained a key strategy for operators in drawing customers looking to purchase handsets in conjunction with specific packages (bundles packages), especially in relation to postpaid customer campaigns."
293,"However, overall spending by mobile operators in marketing campaigns, including the aforementioned discounts, is likely to decrease from the previous year, with a focus instead on more area-based marketing, reflecting tighter control of campaign and cost effectiveness."
294,"Postpaid migration continues, driven by increased smartphone and social media usage In 2018, total market data usage rates continued to increase, with a customer data usage of over 10 GB/ data sub/month thanks to social media applications and the growth of the e-commerce market, along with smartphone usage rate growth to around 77%."
295,"Fixed broadband market increases as fibre service demand grows Throughout the past year, the fixed broadband market has continued to see revenue growth at more than 10%, as the demand for internet connectivity in residential areas continues to increase."
296,"The overall market grew from 8.2 million connected households in 2017 to over 9.3 million in 2018, or 43% of households with fixed broadband connectivity."
297,"Service providers continue to focus on expanding fibre service coverage, along with seeking out new customers while still maintaining their existing customer base, by using more concentrated pricing strategies, such as issuing fibre packages of 10 Mbps at a starting price of Baht 250."
298,Incumbents have also tried to offer steep discounts to existing customers in the event of customers looking to cancel or change service providers.
299,"For these reasons, the industry ARPU in 2018 has decreased to approximately Baht 580."
300,"However, in order to meet the needs of households requiring internet usage for many family members or connections for multiple devices, service providers continue to offer high-speed fibre packages, such as 1 Gbps packages for the price of Baht 2,999."
301,"Additionally, service providers with other available services apart from high-speed internet continue to offer convergence packages, combining a variety of services into the same package, including high-speed internet, internet SIMs for mobile phones, and content."
302,"Such offers highlight the value of overall packages being greater than simply high-speed internet packages alone, and have more recently greatly increased in popularity with consumers."
303,Industry Trends in 2019 Mobile phone market continues to expand due to 4G services and competition continues.
304,"Throughout 2019, it is expected that the mobile phone market will continue to expand due to 4G usage for video content and social media."
305,"In addition, a gradual reduction of fixed-speed unlimited data packages is expected to help operator revenue to improve gradually."
306,"Nonetheless, competition in the mobile phone market is set to continue in 2019, with expectations that operators will tend towards marketing strategies that focus on quality customers in order to control costs and expenses and to generate increased cash flow to support license 33 Advanced Info Service Public Company Limited payments and future investments."
307,"4G network quality, both in terms of coverage and speed, is still a key factor in customers’ service choices and decision-making process."
308,"In addition, brand image and various other privileges will be more important to competitiveness in areas where the network quality of operators is not very dissimilar."
309,"Current trends also show that operators are increasingly utilizing modern technology to learn about customer behaviors, helping them to provide better products and services for each customer."
310,"In terms of spectrum demand in order to provide more services, when considering spectrum allocation in the past year and the relatively low level of interest in bidding on said spectrums, it is expected that operators have retained sufficient frequencies to serve their customers for a certain period of time."
311,"Additionally, existing conditions and auction prices may not be sufficiently attractive or may not yet create enough additional value for business operations at this time."
312,"Not only that, but currently there are increased numbers of customers switching from 3G to 4G usage, making it possible to allocate more frequencies between technologies."
313,"Therefore, demand for additional spectrum auctions for 4G services may yet remain unclear in 2019."
314,"Preparations for 5G technology Over the next 2-3 years, the trends for 5G technology usage will become clearer, whereby cooperation between both government and private enterprises to create greater awareness and education about technology and to seek out new business models together will be important factors in the increased emergence of 5G technology for maximum benefit."
315,"This also includes greater clarity with regard to frequency allocation, as appropriate frequency allocation will help encourage more effective investment in 5G technology and enhance the country’s growth in a wide variety of businesses and industries."
316,"According to current standards, frequency bands that can be used to provide 5G technology services consist of those below 1GHz (Low Band), such as 700MHz; those in the range between 1GHz and 6GHz (Mid Band), such as 2.6GHz and 3.4 – 3.8GHz; as well as frequency bands above 24GHz (High Band), such as 26-28GHz, etc."
317,"It is therefore expected that operators, in collaboration with their partners, will begin increased preparation of their networks to support 5G technology."
318,"This includes, for example, plans for investment in Massive MIMO, which allows the transmitting and receiving of data signals using multiple antennas, as well as continued communications with the NBTC regarding opportunities to start the testing of 5G technology in some areas before going ahead with actual investment and commercial usage."
319,"This would also allow service providers to contribute information to the NBTC regarding the current industry conditions and financial burdens placed on operators, which would support the NBTC in effective planning of spectrum allocation and usage in the country."
320,"Continued fibre service expansion, creating advantages with convergence services The fixed broadband market is expected to continue growing at a similar rate to the previous year, at about 10%, due to the demand for internet connectivity in the home and the ratio of households with fixed broadband that can still expand from current levels of about 43%."
321,It is also expected that operators will continue to focus on the expansion of fibre services and encourage upgrades to fibre technology for customers still using old technology.
322,"At the same time, package value and attractiveness, including effective after-sales services, will become increasingly important to customers’ decision-making processes."
323,It is therefore expected that service providers offering convergence packages will create increased advantages and attract greater numbers of customers than those offering fixed broadband services only.
324,"34 Annual Report 2018 THREE-YEAR BUSINESS DIRECTION As quickly-evolving digital technologies and more sophisticated customer needs continue to emerge, they play a greater role than ever in structural changes for telecommunications operators, ushering the industry into an era of digital transformation."
325,The wider abilities and range of choices of technologies have altered customer behavior to seek access to more comprehensive services as well as providing greater opportunity for mobile operators to access a broader marketplace.
326,"In light of these trends, AIS has redefined aspects of its business model from that of a traditional mobile service provider to that of a “Digital Life Service Provider”, operating three main businesses, namely, mobile phone services, fixed broadband, and digital services, in order to enrich the daily lives and business capabilities of individuals, and the competitive edge of the country."
327,"To this end, we have focused on Digital Transformation in order to take advantage of technologies that expand our capabilities and efficiency, and to achieve sustainable growth in the digital era."
328,"Creating a quality mobile network to deliver a superior user experience With the rapid growth of smartphone usage and faster connections via 4G networks, it is expected that mobile internet usage will continue to increase and expand its roles beyond the need for basic internet connections and data transmission."
329,"We see that digital platforms have empowered the way that people live and work, and thus have become a necessity for many consumers."
330,"In our market leadership position, AIS will continue to focus on improving the quality of 4G networks through research and development with our partners, utilizing modern technology to increase network efficiency, both in terms of coverage and capacity, and providing excellent customer service."
331,"Additionally, over the next 3–5 years, 5G technology standards will become clearer, specifically in terms of frequency and types of services that correspond to speed (Enhanced Mobile Broadband), ultra-low latency, and multiple connectivity (Massive Machine-Type Communications)."
332,"This includes Network Function Virtualization (NFV), helping networks become more efficient and flexible as well as reducing unit costs."
333,"Because of this, 5G technology will allow our company to help support business operations in a variety of industries other than just telecommunications, such as by providing NB-IoT (Narrow-Band Internet of Things) services, which will be one of the most important services to be fully developed when the 5G service is launched."
334,"As such, AIS has already begun to create awareness of these technological changes to all its business sectors and is ready to support 5G services, 35 Advanced Info Service Public Company Limited maximizing the efficiency of the country in general."
335,"Obviously, the spectrum of frequencies that can be utilized as well as the supported devices, applications and new revenue-generating models will be important factors in determining appropriate levels of investment in the long term."
336,"Meeting the demand for high-speed internet with fibre optic network and technology In addition to internet connection via the mobile phone network, demand for household internet connections has steadily increased, with digital services in the future likely to develop beyond current limits in terms of the quality of services and more."
337,"These include, for example, higher resolution content, such as 4K and 8K content which require higher speed internet connections than the currently widely used full HD streaming."
338,"These requirements can be fulfilled with fibre technology, which provides faster and more reliable connections than ADSL technology."
339,AIS sees the potential growth of this market and has set the target of becoming one of the major service providers.
340,"Utilizing nationwide fibre optics from its mobile networks, AIS Fibre will continue to tap into new urban areas and provide services to underserved areas that still lack quality high-speed internet access and/or who still use old ADSL technology."
341,"We will focus on providing a variety of services through the Fixed-Mobile Convergence (FMC) model, through which AIS can offer fixed broadband access along with mobile phone packages and other interesting content to meet the needs of entire families comprehensively."
342,"In this regard, AIS’s investment in fibre optic networks builds upon our current network used for mobile phone services, which is available nationwide."
343,The coverage expansion of fibre optic technology will allow AIS to deliver services that capture growth opportunities according to future trends with economies of scale.
344,"Creating new revenue sources from digital services to general customers and enhancing the potential of enterprises with end-to-end ICT solutions Due to the rapid development of smartphone quality, both in terms of hardware and software, as well as AIS’s quality 4G network, smartphones have become the main communication device used by consumers in their everyday lives."
345,"Additionally, smartphones have also become a major channel for watching content of various kinds as well as for the payment of goods and services via a wide variety of applications."
346,AIS expects that this trend will continue with increased changes in consumer behaviour and therefore continues to focus on developing its platforms for video content (AIS PLAY) and mobile payment channels (Rabbit LINE Pay).
347,This will allow us as an organization to create products and services that are attractive to customers and to provide opportunity for increased company revenue by adding new business models and by leveraging our customer base and platform data.
348,"At the same time, while the business world grows ever more digital, cloud systems and ICT solutions are key factors in enabling digital transformation and play a major role in creating compelling value for enterprises of all shapes and sizes."
349,"To support these growing needs, AIS has stepped further into the enterprise business segment, acquiring CS Loxinfo and partnering with leading providers in the ICT industry while also expanding its IDC services to new locations."
350,"With its extensive mobile network, the company aims to capture growth potential by providing a variety of comprehensive end-to-end services, such as ICT solutions, IDCs, and cloud services."
351,"These services will enhance business capability, optimize cost efficiency, and ensure system security for corporate customers."
352,"Additionally, this type 36 Annual Report 2018 of ICT development also serves to enhance the country’s economic development and competitive advantage amid the fast-changing environment of the business world of today."
353,"Personnel development for the digital age and leveraging technologies to improve operational efficiency With the goal of developing the capabilities of our organization, AIS continues to utilize technology in our operations and comprehensive customer services."
354,"We truly believe that our employees are a major key to our long-term, sustainable success."
355,"To this end, we introduced the AIS Innovation Center in order to build staff competency and encourage a growth mindset, ushering in a digital culture and learning platform that allows our employees to respond to rapid changes and disruptive innovation."
356,"In the very near future, Predictive Analytics Tools and Customer Value Management (CVM) will evolve to the next level."
357,"Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be integrated into our services and operations, resulting in improved sales and efficiency."
358,This increased digital transformation will allow the company to offer products and services that better meet the needs of each and every one of our customers.
359,"37 Advanced Info Service Public Company Limited RISK FACTORS To identify the risks that have the potential to impact AIS’s business objectives, goals and opportunities, AIS considers the following factors: 1."
360,"Internal and external factors such as human resources, changes in technology and regulations, customers behaviors as well as the business environment 2."
361,"Extreme events such as floods, fires or other natural disasters or ongoing conditions that have adverse effects on the Company’s work practices or business competitiveness 3."

364,The causes of such potentially adverse events 6.
365,New initiatives or new products and services that AIS is seeking to develop 7.
366,Opportunities to identify new value adding activities.
367,Risk identification process Risks from Industry Regulation and Government Policies 1.
368,"Risk from changes in government policies, rules, regulations and orders of regulators AIS operates under the supervision of NBTC, the organization responsible for regulating the telecommunications industry and with the legal authority to issue rules, regulations and orders to regulate the licensees."
369,"The rules, regulations, and orders issued in the future, such as those that relate to fixing the tariff structure and service fees, or issuing rules and measures for consumer protection, have the potential to affect the Company’s business operations, reduce the Company’s ability to generate profit and/or increase the cost of services."

1428,"These financial reporting standards were aimed at alignment with the corresponding International Financial Reporting Standards, with most of the changes directed towards revision of wording and terminology, and provision of interpretations and accounting guidance to users of standards."
1429,"The adoption of these financial reporting standards does not have any significant impact on the Group’s and the Company’s financial statements, except the following financial reporting standard : Thai Accounting Standard No.7 (Revised 2017) “Statement of Cash Flows” This revised accounting standard requires the disclosure of changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash changes."
1430,This accounting standard requires prospective method for such amendment.
1431,"TFRS 15 requires retrospective method in accordance with Thai Accounting Standard No.8 “Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors” or recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying this Standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings of the annual reporting period."
1432,The core principle of TFRS 15 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects to consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1433,"Specifically, the Standard introduces a 5-step approach to revenue recognition: Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract."
1434,"Step 3: Determine the transaction price Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation Under TFRS 15, an entity recognizes revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e."
1435,when ‘control’ of the goods or services underlying the particular performance obligation is transferred to the customer.
1436,"It applies to the classification of financial instruments, from the perspective of the issuer, into financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments; the classification of related interest, dividends, losses and gains; the circumstances in which financial assets and financial liabilities should be offset."
1437,An entity shall apply this accounting standard prospective method by recoginising all transactions on the date of initial application considering the condition of this accounting standard and the cumulative effect of initially applying this Standard as an adjustment of retained earnings or other component equity (if applicable) on the date of initial application.
1438,The entity shall disclose that fact.
1439,"If an entity initially applies this financial reporting standard, it needs not present comparative information for the disclosures about the nature and extent of risks arising from the financial instruments."
1440,"Thai Financial Reporting Standard No.9 “Financial Instruments” The financial reporting standard establishes principles for the financial reporting of financial assets and financial liabilities that will present relevant and useful information to users of financial statements for their assessment of the amounts, timing and uncertainty of an entity’s future cash flows."
1441,"This financial reporting standard includes 3 requirements for the recognition and measurement, impairment and hedge accounting."
1442,All recognized financial assets that are within the scope of TFRS 9 are required to be subsequently measured at amortized cost or fair value.
1443,"Specifically, debt investments that are held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows, and that have contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principle and interest on the principle outstanding are generally measured at amortized cost at the end of subsequent accounting periods."
1444,"Debt instruments that are held within a business model whose objective is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets, and that have contractual terms that give rise on specific dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principle and interest on the principal amount outstanding, are generally measured at FVTOCI."
1445,All other debt investments and equity investments are measured at their fair value at the end of subsequent accounting periods.
1446,"In addition, under TFRS 9, entities may make an irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in the fair value of an equity investment (that is not held for trading nor contingent consideration recognized by an acquirer in a business combination) in other comprehensive income, with only dividend income generally recognized in profit or loss."
1447,Changes in fair value attributable to a financial liability’s credit risk are not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss.
1448,"In relation to the impairment of financial assets, TFRS 9 requires an expected credit loss model."
1449,The expected credit loss model requires an entity to account for expected credit loss and changes in those expected credit losses at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition.
1450,"In other words, it is no longer necessary for a credit event to have occurred before credit losses are recognized."
1451,"TFRS 9 have been introduced to the types of transactions eligible for hedge accounting, specifically broadening the types of instruments that qualify for hedging instruments and the types of risk components of non-financial items that are eligible for hedge accounting."
1452,"In addition, the effectiveness test has been overhauled with the principle of an ‘economic relationship’."
1453,Disclosure requirements about an entity’s risk management activities have also been introduced.
1454,"An entity can elect to apply this Standard retrospectively, in accordance with Thai Accounting Standard No.8 (Revised 2018) “Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors”."
1455,This Standard shall not be applied to items that have already been derecognized at the date of initial application.
1456,"Or, an entity can elect to apply this Standard by recognizing the cumulative effect of initially applying this Standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings (or other component of equity, as appropriate) of the annual reporting period."
1457,The entity shall disclose that fact.
1458,Thai Financial Reporting Standard Interpretations No.16 “Hedge of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation” This Interpretation describes the significant issue about hedging the foreign currency risk arising from its net investment in foreign operations such as a presentational currency not exposure to risk that an entity applies for hedge accounting and hedging instruments that are hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation.
1459,This Interpretation requires prospective method for such application.
1460,Thai Financial Reporting Standard Interpretations No.19 “Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments” This Interpretation addresses the circumstance that an entity issues equity instruments to a creditor of the entity to extinguish all or part of the financial liability.
1461,The entity shall remove all or part of such financial liability.
1462,This Interpretation requires retrospective method for such application.
1463,"These financial reporting standards were aimed at alignment with the corresponding International Financial Reporting Standards, with most of the changes directed towards revision of wording and terminology and reference to other TFRSs except following TFRSs, which there are revision or additional paragraph and accounting guidance."
1464,"An entity shall make this election separately for each associate or joint venture, at initial recognition of the associate or joint venture."
1465,This accounting standard requires retrospective method for such amendment.
1466,"In addition to, this revised accounting standard clarifies the consideration about the impairment of an investment in an associate or a joint venture."
1467,"Thai Accounting Standard No.40 (Revised 2018) “Investment Property” This revised accounting standard clarifies about transfers of investment property to, or from, other accounts when, and only when, there is a change in use."
1468,This accounting standard requires prospective method for such amendment.
1469,Thai Financial Reporting Standard No.2 (Revised 2018) “Share-based Payment” This revised financial reporting standard adds the requirements as follows.
1470,1) The requirement about treatment of vesting and non-vesting for a cash-settled share-based payment transaction 2) The requirement about share-based payment transactions with a net settlement feature for withholding tax obligations 3) The requirement about accounting for a modification of a share-based payment transaction that changes its classification from cash-settled to equity- settled This revised financial reporting standard requires prospective method for such amendment.
1471,"1) Temporary exemption from TFRS 9 An entity its activities are predominantly connected with insurance, shall elect to apply accounting guidance “Financial Instruments” and disclosure for insurance industry rather than TFRS 9 for annual periods beginning before January 1, 2022 or before TFRS 17 is effective."
1472,2) The Overlay approach This method is not permitted to apply in Thailand.
1473,The Group’s management will adopt such TFRSs in the preparation of the Group’s financial statements when it becomes effective.
1474,The Group’s management is in the process to assess the impact of these TFRSs on the financial statements of the Group in the period of initial application.
1475,The Group’s management considered that TFRS 15 establishes model of accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers.
1476,The standard requires companies to apportion revenue earned from contracts to performance obligations based on a five-step model on a relative standalone selling price basis.
1477,It also introduces contract cost guidance and requires certain additional disclosures.
1478,"The adoption of TFRS 15 will have the following key effects: 1) An increase in revenue allocated to sales of goods, which are fair valued at standalone selling price, and a reduction in revenue from rendering of mobile services over the customer contract period."
1479,2) Subsidy of device paid to dealer will be capitalized and amortized against revenue from rendering of mobile services over the customer contract period.
1480,3) Customer acquisition cost such as dealers’ commission and own sales force’s commission will be capitalized as asset and amortized as distribution cost over the customer contract period.
1481,4) Contract assets will be increased from allocation of revenue to sales of goods.
1482,Contract asset in the statement of financial position represents the difference between the revenue recognized and the upfront cash consideration received from customers.

2095,247 Advanced Info Service Public Company Limited MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Maintained leadership in mobile business In FY18 competition in mobile industry remained elevated particularly on data pricing with fixed speed unlimited price plan while handset subsidies were more locally-focused compared to last year.
2096,"With accumulation of fixed-speed unlimited subscribers, revenue and ARPU have been pressured."
2097,"However, from 3Q18 onward AIS along with other operators have rebalanced pricing structure to ease impact on ARPU."
2098,"As a result, AIS’s mobile revenue for FY18 was Bt124,601mn, softly growing 1.3% YoY."
2099,"While 4G demand continues to rise, AIS aiming to strengthen our leadership position in delivering the best mobile data network decided to bid for an additional 1800MHz spectrum, resulting in AIS having the largest bandwidth of 2x60MHz in the industry."
2100,"Consequently, we have evidently seen an improvement of network quality against peers while brand perception enhanced."
2101,"That said, we have well added 1mn mobile customers in 2H18."
2102,"Expanded fixed broadband and strengthened digital services AIS Fibre continued to grow healthily, despite intense competition, with revenue reaching Bt4,436mn, a 42% increase YoY."
2103,"The growth was driven by added subscribers of 209,300 or around (estimated) 20% share of industry which totaled year-end subscribers at 730,500."
2104,"On other digital services, AIS continued to scale up several platforms to serve both consumers and enterprises."
2105,Our VDO platform called AIS PLAY received higher awareness and was listed among the top five of video-viewing applications with current active subscribers climbing to 1.7mn.
2106,"The mobile money platform under a joint venture, Rabbit LINE Pay, expanded its payment coverage to the sky train mass transit and grew monthly active users to 850,000."
2107,The enterprise business strengthened by CSL acquisition helped enhance AIS’s capability to serve enterprise segment in areas such as enterprise data service and cloud which grew double digit while both AIS and CSL continued to have presence as strong brands in the market.
2108,"Implemented company-wide cost optimization With low growth market, AIS has been focusing on optimizing and digitizing the core operation including network and service."
2109,This resulted in overall network OPEX (excluding cost of TOT partnership) to stay flat YoY or remained at 8% of core service revenue.
2110,The focus on effective spending amidst intense competition also translated into a 4% reduction in total marketing expenses YoY.
2111,FY18 CAPEX was lowered as 4G coverage was mostly completed and investment of Bt20bn was to mainly support added capacity and FBB network.
2112,"Expect mid-single digit growth in FY19 In summary, AIS delivered Bt133,429mn of core service revenue for FY18, a growth of 3.8% YoY."
2113,"EBITDA increased 4.7% YoY to stand at Bt73,792mn or a margin (excluding equipment rental) of 45.2%, up from 44.7% in FY17."

2117,"Significant Event for FY19 Since 1 January 2019, AIS has adopted Thai Financial Reporting Standards (TFRS) 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers."
2118,The standard affects the accounting of handset campaigns which are contracted with price plans.
2119,"Prior to 2019, AIS fully expensed handset subsidy as either handset loss or marketing expense."
2120,"With the effect of TFRS 15, key financial changes, compared to prior to 2019, will be as follows: 248 Annual Report 2018 • Device subsidy previously recognized as handset loss will be reallocated between device sales and service revenue weighted by fair market values of the handset price and full-contract price plan."
2121,"As a result, device sales would increase and service revenue would decrease."
2122,"Also, device subsidy recognized as marketing expense will be capitalized as contract assets and amortized against the service revenue over the customer contract term."

2127,"Market and Competitive Environment Following the softened mobile growth last quarter, operators have gradually stopped providing fixed-speed unlimited price plans and expect the impact of suppressed ARPU to slowly be unwind."
2128,Handset subsidies remained elevated in 4Q18 due to seasonality while aggressive campaigns remained in targeted areas.
2129,"After completing spectrum auctions in 3Q18, overall 4G networks have improved following the deployment of the additional bandwidth, which is expected to help control operator’s investment plans in the following year."
2130,Competition in fixed broadband in 4Q18 was stable from the last quarter without prominent price cut.
2131,"However, throughout the year the standard speed of the market has shifted from 30Mbps in 2017 to 50Mbps in 2018 with a similar price range of around Bt600."
2132,"Overall, pure broadband operators mainly used pricing strategy while integrated operators increasingly emphasized convergence offerings highlighting on higher package value."
2133,This has resulted in the narrowing price gap between pure and convergence price plans.
2134,"4Q18 Financial and Operational Summary In 4Q18, core service revenue was Bt33,683mn, increasing 3.3% YoY and 1.7% QoQ, driven by both mobile and fixed broadband business."

2154,"� Interconnection charge (IC) and equipment rental were Bt10,576mn, increasing 142% YoY due to full-year recognition of equipment rental incurred from the change in accounting on partnership with TOT since Mar-18, partially offset by lower IC from a decline in IC rate."
2155,"SIM & device sales were Bt25,851mn increasing 4.3% YoY."
2156,"SIM and device margin in 2018 was –3.5%, same level as in 2017, following continued handset campaigns."

2165,"� Marketing expenses were Bt9,550mn declining 4.4% YoY due to more targeted handset campaigns."
